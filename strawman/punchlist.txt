Issues / questions ISO 27001/2 analysis

* Information capture options

  Scrape (PDF), EPUB, or STS?
  (Note that we can use mocked up or obfuscated data for demo)

* Walkthrough? Would love to learn what team has learned about ISO 27001

* Surrounding materials (intro/front matter etc etc) - out of scope?

* Discussion of NISO STS (alignment)
