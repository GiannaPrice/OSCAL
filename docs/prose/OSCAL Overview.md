# OSCAL Overview
Overview of the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)

Before discussing OSCAL, it is important to define three key OSCAL terms:
 * *Control*: A safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security and/or privacy requirements. While this is based on the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 definition of "control", in the context of OSCAL it refers to a similar kind of requirement from a control catalog. 
 * *Catalog*: A set of security control definitions. Examples include the hundreds of controls in NIST SP 800-53, the 100+ controls in ISO 27002, and the practices in COBIT 5. 
 * *Profile*: A set of security requirements; also called a baseline or overlay. Examples include the control baselines in NIST SP 800-53, the FedRAMP baselines, and the PCI DSS requirements. A profile is basically selecting a set of security requirements from one or more control catalogs.
