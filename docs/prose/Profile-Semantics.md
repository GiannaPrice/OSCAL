# OSCAL PROFILING SEMANTICS SPECIFICATION

## REQUIREMENTS for profile resolution / rendering / merge

* Include controls from multiple sources
* Allow multiple imports from same source (directly or indirectly)
* Resulting (selected) control set has no duplicates or ambiguity ('duplicate' to be defined)
* The order and organization of controls in profile resolution must be deterministic, i.e always the same, although not always reversible. The hierarchies either of controls within their original catalogs, or import hierarchies (from profiles calling profiles), need not be represented directly, except as stipulated by requirements to "preserve" as part of "merge" semantics
* Errors are to be delivered as messages with no other outputs. Internally, an incorrect "provisionally resolved" profile may be produced, and may be made available to processors for diagnostics or other purposes, but a conforming implementation must (by default) deliver only an appropriate message.

In OSCAL, "profiling semantics" refers to the way OSCAL profile instances make reference to catalogs from which their controls are derived. It is an "as if" sketch that describes the *basics* of any OSCAL system that processes profiles especially if and as those profiles integrate with each other and with catalogs (by further reference).

## Implementation

This document describes OSCAL profile semantics as a set of relations and operations between catalogs, controls, and the import or utilization of those controls that constitute OSCAL profiles. These operations are sometimes described here in terms that may imply a particular implementation or implementation strategy; to the extent that occurs, such description is not normative: any implementation that *delivers the same results* as the process described here, is conformant. In particular, although the process here occurs in three stages, these are conceptual steps: an implementation may work otherwise (as long as the outputs are the same).

We have an implementation of these specifications in XSLT, which serves as a point of reference and testbed for viability. Similarly, validation of (XML OSCAL) against many of the constraints described here can be achieved with Schematron we make available in the public library. In all cases where those tools fail to deliver the results described here, they should be regarded as in error (i.e. this specification takes precedence).

## Terms of art

A **control** is a structured data object. Controls have arbitrary contents, which must be passed through unchanged except where these semantics depict modifications to them. A **subcontrol** is a special kind of control, in a fixed relation to another control (which it "extends"), but like controls in all other respects. While a control may have any number of subcontrols associated (or none), a subcontrol is associated directly (extends) only a single control. In these specifications, controls and subcontrols are together described as *components* (of a catalog or of a profile invoking a catalog). Generally speaking, controls and subcontrols are interchangeable in these specifications (and work the same way in implementation) with the proviso that a subcontrol will never appear in a catalog or profile without its control also appearing.

Controls and subcontrols are addressable within their catalogs by means of unique identifiers. Note in particular that often, catalogs will present controls with a range of controlled values, any number of which may be validated as unique to that control. Only one of these will be the ID in the model. (In XML, the `@id` is used. For interchange with XML systems it is recommended that these values conform to the 'name' production rules, i.e. alphanumerics, no spaces, not beginning with digits.)

A **catalog** is an authoritative, canonical organization of controls and possibly subcontrols. Within a catalog, controls may be collected in **groups**, and groups may be collected into groups. Information described in the catalog as the group level (i.e., associated with the group) may be inherited (implicitly and sometimes explicitly) within controls in that group; to support this, profile resolution as described here sees to it that when controls are invoked (included), the information that comes with them by virtue of group membership, also comes with them. 

A **profile** is an OSCAL data object ("document") that cites (by reference) controls while also specifying (declaring) conditions and modifications for those controls. These modifications may take the form of either assignment of values to **parameters** (which can be done independently of the controls that may use the parameters) and/or of specific modifications ("patches") made to components (controls or subcontrols). Usually such modifications will be simply augmentation or supplementation but in general any modification may be possible.

As a document or data instance, a profile thus represents a "delta" between controls in a catalog, and the same controls in a putative or "virtual" **resolved profile**.

However, a profile may not only cite controls from catalogs; it may also do the same from other profiles. When it does so, its selection is limited to controls as invoked -- and modified -- by those upstream profiles. Thus a resolved profile will represent selections and settings (including changes and alterations) made by *all* the profiles that it cites, in a chain. If profile B modifies controls from catalog A, profile C that modifies profile B, will include its controls *as modified*.

Moreover, a profile may combine controls from multiple catalog sources into a single "collective" control set. This enables profiles to refer to multiple authorities (other profiles, or catalogs) to achieve a synthesis-with-modification of their controls. For example, a common way of extending a community-standard profile is to include controls from that profile's own source catalog (going back to "the beginning") along with the (modified) controls in the "base" profile being extended..

## Exceptions in profiles (summary)

* broken references (to controls, subcontrols or parameters that do not exist)
* the same catalog or profile is called (directly) more than once
* the same parameter (in the same catalog) is assigned more than once
* a subcontrol is included, without its control also being included
* any control (after resolution) is called more than once
* any circular reference (a profile calling a profile that calls back again)

Expected/okay:

* Controls from the same groups (in the same catalogs) coming in via different import pathways

## Profile Resolution

Described here:

* Import (of sources or resources) and selection (of controls and subcontrols)
* Merging - how these control sets are organized in the resolved profile
* Modification - how parameters are set, their values inserted, and patches applied

### Invocation and selection

A profile may combine more than one import.

An import is bound to a single catalog or profile, its "resource". If bound to a profile, it is *implicitly* resolved according to these same rules. Because profiles must be bound to either catalogs, or profiles, this means that (ipso facto) all profiles capable of finite resolution, resolve eventually to catalogs.

If an OSCAL profile includes, directly or indirectly, any imports of itself as a resource, such imports are inoperable. Such circular reference is an error. *(Sch.? Fallback behavior: ignore circular calls.)*  Because circular references are defined as inoperable, in the real world all profiles will be finite.

An import can identify controls (as given in and by the resource) for inclusion in either of two ways. The first method is by an explicit "call" using the ID of the desired control or subcontrol. (See on IDs below.)

Alternatively, an import can stipulate that all controls from the catalog (or upstream profile) should be included, except as modified by exclusion.

An import can also designate controls or subcontrols to be excluded. Ordinarily this will only be done when all controls (or all subcontrols, as applicable) have been included.

An explicit selection or "call" (to be included or excluded) is made by ID value on a target control or subcontrol object (in XML, the element's @id).

It is not an error if the same resource (catalog or profile) is called by more than one import. *(This is Schematronable. Fallback: process anyway. Complementary call sets will resolve; duplicate calls or multiple settings will result in duplicative or contradictory outputs.)*

Invocations can select controls by inclusion or by exclusion. If an import does not indicate an inclusion, then all controls from the invoked resource are implicitly included. (In the XML, no `/invoke/include` is the same as having `/invoke/include/all`. Accordingly, solo `/invoke/exclude` with no "include" stated, is meaningful: include everything but what is excluded.)

Subcontrols are regarded as dependent on their controls. If a control is not selected, it is an error if any of its subcontrols are selected. *(Fallback: drop the subcontrol silently.)* When selecting a subcontrol, see to it that its control is also selected, or select the subcontrols implicitly with a setting ("with subcontrols") setting at a higher level.

It is an error if an import includes a control or subcontrol more than once. *(Sch. Fallback: include a single copy of the control.)*

Similarly, it is an error if an import declares more than one modification (patch) for a given control. *(Sch. Fallback: apply all patches in order defined by processor.)*

Likewise, it is an error if an import declares parameter settings for the same parameter, more than once. *(Sch. Fallback: use only one, tbd by processor.)*

It is not an error if the same control is both included explicitly, and then excluded (by definition, to no effective purpose), but an implementation may warn if this occurs. *(Sch.)* A working assumption is that only imports with "all" controls included (implicitly or explicitly) will have use for exclusions.

It is also not an error if a resolved import selects the same control set as a much more parsimonious import would (for example, instead of including 249 of 250 controls in a catalog, simply include all and exclude one.) Again, an implementation may detect this situation and offer warnings. *(Sch.)*

#### IDs

IDs are expected to be unique within document scope, so no control or subcontrol will have the same ID as another in the same catalog. Control catalogs whose controls are not tagged with distinct IDs can be excluded from resolution as invalid, although conforming processors have the option of continuing to process while offering some means of addressing and resolving the ID clash. 

Moreover, for purposes of these specifications, ID values are expected to be unique *across* catalogs. If local (document-level) ID collision occurs between catalogs, a system is expected to resolve them such that all controls from all catalogs can be addressed distinctly, each call resolving relative to its import. Catalogs, however, must also be valid to relevant OSCAL schemas and Schematrons demonstrating their structural integrity. This specification does not define what happens with non-OSCAL inputs to profile resolution.

Note also that it is an expectation that every time a given profile or catalog is invoked, the *same resource* (catalog or resolved profile) is returned, enabling systems to cache. (Cf XPath doc() function.) Along with this is the assumption that resolution of a profile against its sources (profiles and catalogs) will be side-effect free; for example, it cannot have the effect of rewriting catalogs or upstream profiles (by calling some magical URI) or creating new resources to be exploited elsewhere.

We do not yet support selection of controls by other criteria such as context/organization ("all of AC") or controlled property values ("controls that have X=Y").

### Merge (Combination)

XXX NB THIS ENTIRE SECTION MAY ALTER RADICALLY XXX
cf New-Merge-Diagrams.html

In profile resolution, a "view" is provided of *each* resource (profile or catalog) invoked by a profile, which preserves information regarding the import including the structural relations (groupings) among controls selected by it. Because multiple imports may trace back through several import steps, to the same catalog (such as, for example, NIST SP800-53), this means that the resolved profile will contain more than one "copy" (partial or complete) of the organization (groups) within which controls are organized.

Note that since profiles can invoke profiles, the views of imports may be nested, as many layers deep as it takes to get back to a catalog. Also, because profiles may invoke controls from more than a single upstream resource (catalog or profile), views will contain multiple views, in a branching structure. Occasionally, views within views will point to the same source catalogs as other views (within views); this will happen both in error, and as a feature. In any case it will sometimes be valuable or useful information, to know not only that a control was included but *how* it was included -- its provenance of import.

Within each view, at the deepest layer, a profile will invoke not another profile (making for another view), but a catalog. At that point, the resolved profile will present a partial (filtered) "snapshot" of the catalog in question, showing the controls that are (finally) selected (by the views in combination).

This snapshot will show a *copy* of the catalog with the following modifications:

* A group that does not contain any control, selected by the profile, is discarded.

* A group that contains a selected control (either directly or by virtue of subgroups) is copied, with its properties and contents (statements, parts, paragraphs etc), as well as any selected controls or groups that contain (at any level) selected controls.

* Only controls that are selected by the profile, are kept.

* Within controls, only subcontrols that are selected by the profile, are kept. (Note that the means of selection of subcontrols is different from that of the controls on which they depend.)

* Parameter descriptions and values are *unchanged*. (They will be changed in the subsequent "Modify" step.)

More info here: [Profile Invocation Merge Diagrams](Merge-Diagrams.html)

It is noteworthy that this organization, while it has the advantage of low information loss, will not be ideal for many purposes. Accordingly, an additional **merge** step may be performed.

In this context, to "merge" means to collapse a "multiply refracted" combination of views on a single catalog (made by assembling disparate profiles into a profile), into a single integrated view.

This operation is provided as an *optional* step.

* A profile with more than one import, resolves them separately. Invocations are resolved separately within a profile.
* Recursive profile resolution is reflected in the import hierarchy
* The same catalog can appear at multiple terminals in an import hierarchy
* Among controls selected in an import, a catalog's grouping organization is retained
* Because selection can occur at any level of profiling, distinct import pathways (each subsetting controls and/or adding branches of their own) will result in very different representations of "fragmented groupings" of control catalogs. Unless these actually select the same controls, this is not necessarily an error. Where they do, they expose issues to be resolved. This occurrence above all should be exposed while being flagged as an error. 

### Modification

The matching/selection logic of patches described in this spec is in DRAFT form, inasmuch as we expect (hope) to define more flexible and powerful mechanism in a future sprint.

Currently, two distinct types of modification are supported: setting parameters (values, default values, descriptions); and direct modification ("patching") of controls and subcontrols. A small set of element types are provided to support the latter, including directives for deleting contents and adding new contents to the control or subcontrol.

See the Tag Library for more on elements `alter`, `remove` and `augment` when used inside `modify`. See the Mini Testing samples for examples.
