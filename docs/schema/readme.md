# OSCAL schema documentation

This subdirectory contains [documentation, in OSCAL XML format](oscal-oscal.xml), of the OSCAL schema and related resources such as Schematron constraint sets.

See an [OSCAL Tag Library](oscal-tag-library.md) (element definitions) in this subdirectory, produced from that file. Currently, only elements are described; TBD are attribute definitions along with more background and perhaps examples.

The XML also serves as an example of OSCAL, but for more correct or realistic examples with richer semantics, see [subdirectories under 'working'](../..), including [NIST SP800-53](../../SP800-53), [ISO 27002](../../ISO-27002), and [COBIT 5](../../COBIT5).

The publication version of the OSCAL schema may be found in the [lib/XSD](../../lib/XSD) directory as file [oscal-documented.xsd](../../lib/XSD/oscal-documented.xsd). This file is produced via an automated process [as described there](../../lib/XSD/readme.md). A mirror copy may be available in this subdirectory but it may be best to check dates.
