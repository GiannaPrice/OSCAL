# About the Sample Schemas

#Design Principles for Sample Schemas
The sample database schemas have been created with the following design principles
in mind:
- Simplicity and ease of use.
- Relevance for typical users. The base schemas and their extensions bring to the
foreground the functionality that producers typically use. The entire set of
schemas provides a foundation upon which one can expand to illustrate additional
functionality.
- Extensibility. The sample schemas provide a logical and physical foundation for
adding objects to demonstrate functionality beyond the fundamental scope.
- Relevance. The sample schemas are designed to be applicable to e-business and
other significant industry trends (for example, XML).
