            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the access control family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The access control policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Access control procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the access control policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information-system level, access enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Consideration is given to the implementation of an audited, explicit override of automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is employed as an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant. For classified information, the cryptography used is largely dependent on the classification level of the information and the clearances of the individuals having access to the information. Mechanisms implemented by AC-3 are configured to enforce authorizations determined by other security controls.

                  <p>For Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Policy establishes coverage over all subjects and objects under its control to ensure that each user receives only that information to which the user is authorized access based on classification of the information, and on user clearance and formal access authorization. The information system assigns appropriate security attributes (e.g., labels/security domains/types) to subjects and objects, and uses these attributes as the basis for MAC decisions. The Bell-LaPadula security model defines allowed access with regard to an organization-defined set of strictly hierarchical security levels as follows: A subject can read an object only if the security level of the subject dominates the security level of the object and a subject can write to an object only if two conditions are met: the security level of the object dominates the security level of the subject, and the security level of the users clearance dominates the security level of the object (no read up, no write down). </p>
                  <p>For Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Policy establishes coverage over all users and resources to ensure that access rights are grouped by role name, and access to resources is restricted to users who have been authorized to assume the associated role.</p>

            <p>Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A few examples of flow control restrictions include: keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics). Mechanisms implemented by AC-4 are configured to enforce authorizations determined by other security controls. Related controls: AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2, SC-5, SC-7, SC-18.</p>

                  <p>Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes on all information (data content and data structure), source and destination objects, and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by the information flow policy. Information flow enforcement using explicit security attributes can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of information.</p>

                  <p>Organization-defined security policy filters include, for example, dirty word filters, file type checking filters, structured data filters, unstructured data filters, metadata content filters, and hidden content filters. Structured data permits the interpretation of its content by virtue of atomic elements that are understandable by an application and indivisible. Unstructured data refers to masses of (usually) digital information that does not have a data structure or has a data structure that is not easily readable by a machine. Unstructured data consists of two basic categories: (i) bitmap objects that are inherently non language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and (ii) textual objects that are based on a written or printed language (i.e., commercial off-the-shelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails).</p>

                  <p>Transferring information between interconnected information systems of differing security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more policies. While security policy violations may not be absolutely prohibited, policy guidance from information owners/stewards is implemented at the policy enforcement point between the interconnected systems. Specific architectural solutions are mandated, when required, to reduce the potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities. Architectural solutions include, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e. implementing access only, one way transfer mechanisms); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce unitary information flow directions; and (iii) implementing fully tested, re-grading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and associated security labels.</p>

The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in an information system, allows forensic reconstruction of events when required, and increases policy compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals.

The organization may differentiate in the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local information system accounts and for domain accounts provided the organization retains the ability to control the configuration of the system with regard to key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.</p>

            <p>Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by the information system are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time period established by the organization. If a delay algorithm is selected, the organization may chose to employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the capabilities of those components. Response to unsuccessful login attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application levels. This control applies to all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in AC-14.</p>

            <p>A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. This is typically at the operating system-level, but may be at the application-level. A session lock is not a substitute for logging out of the information system, for example, if the organization requires users to log out at the end of the workday.</p>

            <p>This control is intended for those specific instances where an organization determines that no identification and authentication is required; it is not, however, mandating that such instances exist in given information system. The organization may allow a limited number of user actions without identification and authentication (e.g., when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems such as http://www.usa.gov). Organizations also identify any actions that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypass may be, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the login functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not being repeated, but rather to situations where identification and/or authentication have not yet occurred. Related control: CP-2, IA-2.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>Security attributes are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers, files) within the information system and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy. The term security label is often used to associate a set of security attributes with a specific information object as part of the data structure for that object (e.g., user access privileges, nationality, affiliation as contractor). Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, SC-16, MP-3.</p>

            <p>This control requires explicit authorization prior to allowing remote access to an information system without specifying a specific format for that authorization. For example, while the organization may deem it appropriate to use a system interconnection agreement to authorize a given remote access, such agreements are not required by this control. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless (see AC-18 for wireless access). A virtual private network when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls, is considered an internal network (i.e., the organization establishes a network connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to depend on external networks to protect the confidentiality or integrity of information transmitted across the network). Remote access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web servers or systems specifically designed for public access. Enforcing access restrictions associated with remote connections is accomplished by control AC-3. Related controls: AC-3, AC-18, AC-20, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4.</p>

            <p>Mobile devices include portable storage media (e.g., USB memory sticks, external hard disk drives) and portable computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording devices). Organization-controlled mobile devices include those devices for which the organization has the authority to specify and the ability to enforce specific security requirements. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance related to mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Examples of information system functionality that provide the capability for automatic execution of code are AutoRun and AutoPlay. </p>
            <p>Organizational policies and procedures for mobile devices used by individuals departing on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are of concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific measures to the device after travel is completed. Specially configured mobile devices include, for example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified measures applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information residing on mobile devices is covered in the media protection family. Related controls: MP-4, MP-5.</p>

            <p>The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Access the information system from the external information systems; and</li>
               <li>Process, store, and/or transmit organization-controlled information using the external information systems.</li>
            </ol>
         </desc>
         <guidance>
            <p>External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by the organization and for which the organization typically has no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness. External information systems include, but are not limited to: (i) personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, or personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of the organization. For some external systems, in particular those systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies, the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. In effect, the information systems of these organizations would not be considered external. These situations typically occur when, for example, there is some pre-existing sharing or trust agreement (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies and/or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other individuals with authorized access to the organizational information system and over which the organization has the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system access. The restrictions that an organization imposes on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions are likely to vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations. Thus, an organization might impose more stringent security restrictions on a contractor than on a state, local, or tribal government. </p>
            <p>This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems and information (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). The organization establishes terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. The terms and conditions address as a minimum; (i) the types of applications that can be accessed on the organizational information system from the external information system; and (ii) the maximum security categorization of information that can be processed, stored, and transmitted on the external information system. This control defines access authorizations enforced by AC-3, rules of behavior requirements enforced by PL-4, and session establishment rules enforced by AC-17. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, PL-4.</p>

The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The security awareness and training policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Security awareness and training procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the security awareness and training policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the audit and accountability family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The audit and accountability policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Audit and accountability procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the audit and accountability policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this control is for the organization to identify events which need to be auditable as significant and relevant to the security of the information system; giving an overall system requirement in order to meet ongoing and specific audit needs. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are to be audited at a given point in time. For example, the organization may determine that the information system must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the extreme burden on system performance. In addition, audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the right level of abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems.

The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by the organization (with localized script adjustments, as necessary), provides a more cost-effective approach for analyzing audit record information collected.

                  <p>Auditing may not be reliable when performed by the information system to which the user being audited has privileged access. The privileged user may inhibit auditing or modify audit records. This control enhancement helps mitigate this risk by requiring that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus, limiting the users with audit-related privileges. Reducing the risk of audit compromises by privileged users can also be achieved, for example, by performing audit activity on a separate information system or by using storage media that cannot be modified (e.g., write-once recording devices).</p>

Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Non-repudiation services are obtained by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts).</p>

                  <p>If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from the release/transfer function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer of the information to be released with the information and the information label. In the case of human reviews, this control enhancement provides appropriate organizational officials the means to identify who reviewed and released the information. In the case of automated reviews, this control enhancement helps ensure that only approved review functions are employed.</p>

                  <p>Audit information normalized to a common standard promotes interoperability and exchange of such information between dissimilar devices and information systems. This facilitates an audit system that produces event information that can be more readily analyzed and correlated. System log records and audit records compliant with the Common Event Expression (CEE) are examples of standard formats for audit records. If individual logging mechanisms within the information system do not conform to a standardized format, the system may convert individual audit records into a standardized format when compiling the system-wide audit trail.</p>

The policies and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The security assessment/authorization policies can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Security assessment/authorization procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the security assessment and authorization policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>The organization assesses the security controls in an information system as part of: (i) security authorization or reauthorization; (ii) meeting the FISMA requirement for annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) testing/evaluation of the information system as part of the system development life cycle process. The assessment report documents the assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the organization, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the report and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements of the information system. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security control assessments should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional assessment requirements to those requirements already in place in the security authorization process. To satisfy the FISMA annual assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) assessments conducted as part of an information system authorization or reauthorization process; (ii) continuous monitoring (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of an information system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle (provided that the testing and evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness). Existing security control assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. </p>
            <p>Subsequent to the initial authorization of the information system and in accordance with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of the security controls annually during continuous monitoring. The organization establishes the security control selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls within the information system and its environment of operation for assessment. Those security controls that are the most volatile (i.e., controls most affected by ongoing changes to the information system or its environment of operation) or deemed critical by the organization to protecting organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation are assessed more frequently in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information systems three-year authorization cycle. The organization can use the current years assessment results from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment requirement provided that the results are current, valid, and relevant to determining security control effectiveness. External audits (e.g., audits conducted by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control. Related controls: CA-6, CA-7, PM-9, SA-11.</p>

                  <p>The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to conduct an assessment of the security controls in the information system.</p>
               </desc>
               <guidance>
                  <p>An independent assessor or assessment team is any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management chain associated with the information system or to the determination of security control effectiveness. Independent security assessment services can be obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of the assessor or assessment team conducting the assessment of the security controls in the information system. The authorizing official determines the required level of assessor independence based on the security categorization of the information system and/or the ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, and to individuals. The authorizing official determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure requires that the assessment be accomplished by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner, independence in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.</p>

                  <p>Penetration testing exercises both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing consists of: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. Detailed rules of engagement are agreed upon by all parties before the commencement of any penetration testing scenario. These rules of engagement are correlated with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by threat-sources in carrying out attacks. An organizational assessment of risk guides the decision on the level of independence required for penetration agents or penetration teams conducting penetration testing. Red team exercises are conducted as a simulated adversarial attempt to compromise organizational missions and/or business processes to provide a comprehensive assessment of the security capability of the information system and organization. While penetration testing may be laboratory-based testing, red team exercises are intended to be more comprehensive in nature and reflect real-world conditions. Information system monitoring, malicious user testing, penetration testing, red-team exercises, and other forms of security testing (e.g., independent verification and validation) are conducted to improve the readiness of the organization by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating current performance levels as a means of focusing organizational actions to improve the security state of the system and organization. Testing is conducted in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Testing methods are approved by authorizing officials in coordination with the organizations Risk Executive Function. Vulnerabilities uncovered during red team exercises are incorporated into the vulnerability remediation process. Related controls: RA-5, SI-2.</p>

            <p>This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as email and website browsing. The organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within the organization and external to the organization. Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with each connection and the appropriate controls employed. If the interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, an Interconnection Security Agreement is not required. Rather, the interface characteristics between the interconnecting information systems are described in the security plans for the respective systems. If the interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials but the authorizing officials are in the same organization, the organization determines whether an Interconnection Security Agreement is required, or alternatively, the interface characteristics between systems are described in the security plans of the respective systems. Instead of developing an Interconnection Security Agreement, organizations may choose to incorporate this information into a formal contract, especially if the interconnection is to be established between a federal agency and a nonfederal (private sector) organization. In every case, documenting the interface characteristics is required, yet the formality and approval process vary considerably even though all accomplish the same fundamental objective of managing the risk being incurred by the interconnection of the information systems. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. Information systems may be identified and authenticated as devices in accordance with IA-3. Related controls: AC-4, IA-3, SC-7, SA-9.</p>

                  <p>An external network is a network that is not controlled by the organization (e.g., the Internet). No direct connection means that an information system cannot connect to an external network without the use of an approved boundary protection device (e.g., firewall) that mediates the communication between the system and the network. In addition, the approved boundary protection device (typically a managed interface/cross-domain system), provides information flow enforcement from the information system to the external network consistent with AC-4.</p>

            <p>Security authorization is the official management decision, conveyed through the authorization decision document, given by a senior organizational official or executive (i.e., authorizing official) to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Authorizing officials typically have budgetary oversight for information systems or are responsible for the mission or business operations supported by the systems. Security authorization is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with information system operations. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information system-related security risks. Through the employment of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process, the critical information contained in the authorization package (i.e., the security plan (including risk assessment), the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing the authorizing official and the information system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, the authorizing official uses the results of the continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering a reauthorization decision. OMB policy requires that federal information systems are reauthorized at least every three years or when there is a significant change to the system. The organization defines what constitutes a significant change to the information system. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.</p>

            <p>A continuous monitoring program allows an organization to maintain the security authorization of an information system over time in a highly dynamic environment of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes. Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools facilitates near real-time risk management and promotes organizational situational awareness with regard to the security state of the information system. The implementation of a continuous monitoring program results in ongoing updates to the security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones, the three principal documents in the security authorization package. A rigorous and well executed continuous monitoring program significantly reduces the level of effort required for the reauthorization of the information system. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categorization of the information system. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the configuration management family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The configuration management policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Configuration management procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the configuration management policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>This control establishes a baseline configuration for the information system and its constituent components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of the system. The baseline configuration provides information about the components of an information system (e.g., the standard software load for a workstation, server, network component, or mobile device including operating system/installed applications with current version numbers and patch information), network topology, and the logical placement of the component within the system architecture. The baseline configuration is a documented, up-to-date specification to which the information system is built. Maintaining the baseline configuration involves creating new baselines as the information system changes over time. The baseline configuration of the information system is consistent with the organizations enterprise architecture. Related controls: CM-3, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9.</p>

            <p>The organization determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration controlled. Configuration change control for the information system involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, test/evaluation, review, and disposition of changes to the system, including upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to components of the information system, changes to the configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers), emergency changes, and changes to remediate flaws. A typical organizational process for managing configuration changes to the information system includes, for example, a chartered Configuration Control Board that approves proposed changes to the system. Auditing of changes refers to changes in activity before and after a change is made to the information system and the auditing activities required to implement the change. Related controls: CM-4, CM-5, CM-6, SI-2.</p>

                  <p>The organization ensures that testing does not interfere with information system operations. The individual/group conducting the tests understands the organizational information security policies and procedures, the information system security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a particular facility and/or process. An operational system may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If an information system must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible. In situations where the organization cannot conduct testing of an operational system, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g., providing a replicated system to conduct testing) in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.</p>

            <p>Security impact analyses are conducted by organizational personnel with information security responsibilities, including for example, Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System Security Managers, and Information System Security Engineers. Individuals conducting security impact analyses have the appropriate skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing information system documentation such as the security plan to understand how specific security controls are implemented within the system and how the changes might affect the controls. Security impact analysis may also include an assessment of risk to understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analysis is scaled in accordance with the security categorization of the information system. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, CM-9, SI-2.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information system can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system. Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals are allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Additionally, maintaining records of access is essential for ensuring that configuration change control is being implemented as intended and for supporting after-the-fact actions should the organization become aware of an unauthorized change to the information system. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Examples of access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes are implemented into a third-party interface rather than directly into the information system component), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). Some or all of the enforcement mechanisms and processes necessary to implement this security control are included in other controls. For measures implemented in other controls, this control provides information to be used in the implementation of the other controls to cover specific needs related to enforcing authorizations to make changes to the information system, auditing changes, and retaining and review records of changes. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.</p>

            <p>Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters related to meeting other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and directory settings (i.e., permissions); and settings for services, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide mandatory configuration settings from which the settings for a given information system are derived. A security configuration checklist (sometimes referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, security guide, security technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark) is a series of instructions or procedures for configuring an information system component to meet operational requirements. Checklists can be developed by information technology developers and vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies (and other government organizations), and others in the public and private sectors. An example of a security configuration checklist is the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) which potentially affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems. Related controls: CM-2, CM-3, SI-4.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and services provided by organizational information systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus [USB], File Transfer Protocol [FTP], Internet Protocol Version 6 [IPv6], Hyper Text Transfer Protocol [HTTP]) on information system components to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.

            <p>Configuration items are the information system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration managed. The configuration management plan satisfies the requirements in the organizations configuration management policy while being tailored to the individual information system. The configuration management plan defines detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities at the information system level. The plan describes how to move a change through the change management process, how configuration settings and configuration baselines are updated, how the information system component inventory is maintained, how development, test, and operational environments are controlled, and finally, how documents are developed, released, and updated. The configuration management approval process includes designation of key management stakeholders that are responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to the information system, and security personnel that would conduct an impact analysis prior to the implementation of any changes to the system.

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the contingency planning family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The contingency planning policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Contingency planning procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the contingency planning policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business operations. Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. Information system recovery objectives are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission/business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of the information system. Examples of actions to call out in contingency plans include, for example, graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to a manual mode, alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when the system is under attack.

            <p>There are several methods for testing and/or exercising contingency plans to identify potential weaknesses (e.g., checklist, walk-through/tabletop, simulation: parallel, full interrupt). Contingency plan testing and/or exercises include a determination of the effects on organizational operations and assets (e.g., reduction in mission capability) and individuals arising due to contingency operations in accordance with the plan.</p>

            <p>System-level information includes, for example, system-state information, operating system and application software, and licenses. Digital signatures and cryptographic hashes are examples of mechanisms that can be employed by organizations to protect the integrity of information system backups. An organizational assessment of risk guides the use of encryption for protecting backup information. The protection of system backup information while in transit is beyond the scope of this control.

            <p>Recovery is executing information system contingency plan activities to restore essential missions and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for returning the information system to its original functional state before contingency plan activation. Recovery and reconstitution procedures are based on organizational priorities, established recovery point/time and reconstitution objectives, and appropriate metrics. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of any interim information system capability that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes an assessment of the fully restored information system capability, a potential system reauthorization and the necessary activities to prepare the system against another disruption, compromise, or failure. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities employed by the organization can be a combination of automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-6, CA-7, SC-24.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the identification and authentication family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The identification and authentication policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Identification and authentication procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the identification and authentication policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).</p>
         </desc>
         <guidance>
            <p>Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers, individuals from allied nations). Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in AC-14. Unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) may need to be considered for detailed accountability of activity. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local or network. Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained by direct connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained through a network connection. Remote access is a type of network access which involves communication through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks that are under the control of the organization. For a virtual private network (VPN), the VPN is considered an internal network if the organization establishes the VPN connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to depend on any external networks across which the VPN transits to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted. Identification and authentication requirements for information system access by other than organizational users are described in IA-8. </p>
            <p>The identification and authentication requirements in this control are satisfied by complying with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with organization-specific implementation plans provided to OMB. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information-system level (i.e., at logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Related controls: AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>The devices requiring unique identification and authentication may be defined by type, by specific device, or by a combination of type and device as deemed appropriate by the organization. The information system typically uses either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for identification or an organizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. The required strength of the device authentication mechanism is determined by the security categorization of the information system.</p>

            <p>Common device identifiers include media access control (MAC) or Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of user identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). It is commonly the case that a user identifier is the name of an information system account associated with an individual. In such instances, identifier management is largely addressed by the account management activities of AC-2. IA-4 also covers user identifiers not necessarily associated with an information system account (e.g., the identifier used in a physical security control database accessed by a badge reader system for access to the information system). Related control: AC-2, IA-2.</p>

            <p>User authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). Many information system components are shipped with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, present a significant security risk, and therefore, are changed upon installation. The requirement to protect user authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of users and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within the information system (e.g., passwords stored in a hashed or encrypted format, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible only with super user privileges). The information system supports user authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during verification stage of biometric authentication. Measures to safeguard user authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords. Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, PL-4, PS-6.</p>

            <p>Non-organizational users include all information system users other than organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in accordance with AC-14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). Accordingly, a risk assessment is used in determining the authentication needs of the organization. Scalability, practicality, and security are simultaneously considered in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Identification and authentication requirements for information system access by organizational users are described in IA-2. Related controls: AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, MA-4.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the incident response family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The incident response policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Incident response procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the incident response policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the system maintenance family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The information system maintenance policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. System maintenance procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the system maintenance policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>Non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network; either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection. Identification and authentication techniques used in the establishment of non-local maintenance and diagnostic sessions are consistent with the network access requirements in IA-2. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part, by other controls. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, IA-2, IA-8, MA-5, MP-6, SC-7.</p>

The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

The media protection policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Media protection procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required.

            <p>Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording devices). An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring restricted access. Organizations document in policy and procedures, the media requiring restricted access, individuals authorized to access the media, and the specific measures taken to restrict access. Fewer protection measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls where the media resides provide adequate protection. Related controls: MP-4, PE-3.</p>

            <p>The term marking is used when referring to the application or use of human-readable security attributes. The term labeling is used when referring to the application or use of security attributes with regard to internal data structures within the information system (see AC-16, Security Attributes). Removable information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media requiring marking. Marking is generally not required for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. Some organizations, however, may require markings for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. Organizations may extend the scope of this control to include information system output devices containing organizational information, including, for example, monitors and printers. Marking of removable media and information system output is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.</p>

            <p>Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording devices). Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other information systems, organizational personnel use extreme caution in the types of information stored on telephone voicemail systems. A controlled area is any area or space for which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections are sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system. </p>
            <p>An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring physical protection. Fewer protection measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls to the facility where the media resides provide adequate protection. </p>
            <p>As part of a defense-in-depth strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting information at rest on selected secondary storage devices. The employment of cryptography is at the discretion of the information owner/steward. The selection of the cryptographic mechanisms used is based upon maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the information. The strength of mechanisms is commensurate with the classification and sensitivity of the information. Related controls: AC-3, AC-19, CP-6, CP-9, MP-2, PE-3.</p>

            <p>Physical and technical security measures for the protection of digital and non-digital media are commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information residing on the media, and consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Locked containers and cryptography are examples of security measures available to protect digital and non-digital media during transport. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and/or integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. An organizational assessment of risk guides: (i) the selection of media and associated information contained on that media requiring protection during transport; and (ii) the selection and use of storage containers for transporting non-digital media. Authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service).

            <p>This control applies to all media subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not considered removable. Sanitization is the process used to remove information from information system media such that there is reasonable assurance that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, and destroying media information, prevent the disclosure of organizational information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. The organization uses its discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if released for reuse or disposal.</p>

                  <p>Portable, removable storage devices (e.g., thumb drives, flash drives, external storage devices) can be the source of malicious code insertions into organizational information systems. Many of these devices are obtained from unknown sources and may contain various types of malicious code that can be readily transferred to the information system through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning such devices is always recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that the device is free of all malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks. Organizations consider sanitization of portable, removable storage devices, for example, when such devices are first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when the organization loses a positive chain of custody for the device. An organizational assessment of risk guides the specific circumstances for employing the sanitization process. Related control: SI-3.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the physical and environmental protection family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The physical and environmental protection policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Physical and environmental protection procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the physical and environmental protection policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. Workstations and associated peripherals connected to (and part of) an organizational information system may be located in areas designated as publicly accessible with access to such devices being safeguarded.

                  <p>This control enhancement applies to server rooms, media storage areas, communications centers, or any other areas within an organizational facility containing large concentrations of information system components. The intent is to provide additional physical security for those areas where the organization may be more vulnerable due to the concentration of information system components. Security requirements for facilities containing organizational information systems that process, store, or transmit Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. See also PS-3, security requirements for personnel access to SCI.</p>

            <p>Physical protections applied to information system distribution and transmission lines help prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Additionally, physical protections are necessary to help prevent eavesdropping or in transit modification of unencrypted transmissions. Protective measures to control physical access to information system distribution and transmission lines include: (i) locked wiring closets; (ii) disconnected or locked spare jacks; and/or (iii) protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays. Related control: PE-2.</p>

            <p>Physical and environmental hazards include, for example, flooding, fire, tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, vandalism, electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and electromagnetic radiation. Whenever possible, the organization also considers the location or site of the facility with regard to physical and environmental hazards. In addition, the organization considers the location of physical entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be in close proximity to the information system and therefore, increase the potential for unauthorized access to organizational communications (e.g., through the use of wireless sniffers or microphones). This control, to include any enhancements specified, may be satisfied by similar requirements fulfilled by another organizational entity other than the information security program. Organizations avoid duplicating actions already covered.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the security planning family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The security planning policy addresses the overall policy requirements for confidentiality, integrity, and availability and can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Security planning procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the security planning policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>The information security program plan can be represented in a single document or compilation of documents at the discretion of the organization. The plan documents the organization-wide program management controls and organization-defined common controls. The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organizations information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls. </p>
            <p>Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems. Related control: PM-8.</p>

            <p>The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information security requirements and associated security controls into the organizations enterprise architecture helps to ensure that security considerations are addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle and are directly and explicitly related to the organizations mission/business processes. This also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an integral security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies. Security requirements and control integration are most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework and supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security controls into enterprise architectures.

            <p>Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an organizations information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated information protection requirements are documented by the organization in accordance with organizational policy and procedure.

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the personnel security family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The personnel security policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Personnel security procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the personnel security policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that individuals understand any security constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for all information system-related property. Exit interviews may not be possible for some employees (e.g., in the case of job abandonment, some illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors). Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of this control is particularly essential for employees or contractors terminated for cause.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the risk assessment family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The risk assessment policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. Risk assessment procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the risk assessment policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective security categorization. Security categorization describes the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals should the information and information system be comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The organization conducts the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of the chief information officer, senior information security officer, information system owner, mission owners, and information owners/stewards. The organization also considers potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts in categorizing the information system. The security categorization process facilitates the creation of an inventory of information assets, and in conjunction with CM-8, a mapping to the information system components where the information is processed, stored, and transmitted.

         <guidance>
            <p>A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective risk assessment. Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and security controls planned or in place to determine the level of residual risk posed to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the operation of the information system. Risk assessments also take into account risk posed to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems. The General Services Administration provides tools supporting that portion of the risk assessment dealing with public access to federal information systems. </p>
            <p>Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted by organizations at various steps in the Risk Management Framework including: information system categorization; security control selection; security control implementation; security control assessment; information system authorization; and security control monitoring. RA-3 is a noteworthy security control in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in the security control selection process during the application of tailoring guidance for security control baselines and when considering supplementing the tailored baselines with additional security controls or control enhancements.</p>

            <p>The security categorization of the information system guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of the vulnerability scans. Vulnerability analysis for custom software and applications may require additional, more specialized techniques and approaches (e.g., web-based application scanners, source code reviews, source code analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for specific functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices and for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow mechanisms. The organization considers using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to test for the presence of vulnerabilities. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are also excellent sources for vulnerability information. In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises are another source of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Related controls: CA-2, CM-6, RA-3, SI-2.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the system and services acquisition family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The system and services acquisition policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. System and services acquisition procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the system and services acquisition policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <ol>
               <li>Security functional requirements/specifications;</li>

            <p>The acquisition documents for information systems, information system components, and information system services include, either explicitly or by reference, security requirements that describe: (i) required security capabilities (i.e., security needs and, as necessary, specific security controls and other specific FISMA requirements); (ii) required design and development processes; (iii) required test and evaluation procedures; and (iv) required documentation. The requirements in the acquisition documents permit updating security controls as new threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new technologies are implemented. Acquisition documents also include requirements for appropriate information system documentation. The documentation addresses user and system administrator guidance and information regarding the implementation of the security controls in the information system. The level of detail required in the documentation is based on the security categorization for the information system. In addition, the required documentation includes security configuration settings and security implementation guidance. FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on configuration requirements for federal information systems.</p>

            <p>The application of security engineering principles is primarily targeted at new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades and is integrated into the system development life cycle. For legacy information systems, the organization applies security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of the hardware, software, and firmware within the system. Examples of security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii) establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii) incorporating security into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring system developers and integrators are trained on how to develop secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs; and (vii) reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.</p>

            <p>An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the authorization boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for adequately mitigating risks arising from the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered to the organization. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationship between the organization and the external provider. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk. The external information system services documentation includes government, service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for any identified instance of noncompliance.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>A defense-in-breadth approach helps to protect information systems (including the information technology products that compose those systems) throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design and development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement). This is accomplished by the identification, management, and elimination of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to mitigate risk.</p>

            <p>The organization requires that the information system meets [<em>Assignment: organization-defined level of trustworthiness</em>].</p>
         </desc>
         <guidance>
            <p>The intent of this control is to ensure that organizations recognize the importance of trustworthiness and making explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing, developing, and implementing organizational information systems. Trustworthiness is a characteristic or property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by the system. Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of an information system include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features or functions employed within the system); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). </p>
            <p>Appropriate security functionality for the information system can be obtained by using the Risk Management Framework (Steps 1, 2, and 3) to select and implement the necessary management, operational, and technical security controls necessary to mitigate risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Appropriate security assurance can be obtained by: (i) the actions taken by developers and implementers of security controls with regard to the design, development, implementation, and operation of those controls; and (ii) the actions taken by assessors to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information system. </p>
            <p>Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security controls by employing well-defined security policy models, structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques, and sound system/security engineering principles. Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the initiation, acquisition/development, implementation, and operations/maintenance phases of the system development life cycle. For example, developmental evidence may include the techniques and methods used to design and develop security functionality. Operational evidence may include flaw reporting and remediation, the results of security incident reporting, and the results of the ongoing monitoring of security controls. Independent assessments by qualified assessors may include analyses of the evidence as well as testing, inspections, and audits. Minimum assurance requirements are described in Appendix E. </p>
            <p>Explicit trustworthiness decisions highlight situations where achieving the information system resilience and security capability necessary to withstand cyber attacks from adversaries with certain threat capabilities may require adjusting the risk management strategy, the design of mission/business processes with regard to automation, the selection and implementation rigor of management and operational protections, or the selection of information technology components with higher levels of trustworthiness. Trustworthiness may be defined on a component-by-component, subsystem-by-subsystem, or function-by-function basis. It is noted, however, that typically functions, subsystems, and components are highly interrelated, making separation by trustworthiness perhaps problematic and at a minimum, something that likely requires careful attention in order to achieve practically useful results.

            <p>This control is intended to produce the policy and procedures that are required for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the system and communications protection family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The system and communications protection policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. System and communications protection procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the system and communications protection policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services) from information system management functionality.</p>
         </desc>
         <guidance>
            <p>Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical or logical and is accomplished by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of the operating system, different network addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods as appropriate. An example of this type of separation is observed in web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. This may include isolating the administrative interface on a different domain and with additional access controls.</p>

            <p>The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains) that controls access to and protects the integrity of, the hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. The information system maintains a separate execution domain (e.g., address space) for each executing process. Related control: SA-13.</p>

Control of information in shared resources is also referred to as object reuse. This control does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been in some way nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels where shared resources are manipulated to achieve a violation of information flow restrictions; or (iii) components in the information system for which there is only a single user/role.</p>

Managed interfaces employing boundary protection devices include, for example, proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, or encrypted tunnels arranged in an effective security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls and application gateways residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a demilitarized zone or DMZ). </p>
            <p>The organization considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may include third-party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such interconnecting transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. Related controls: AC-4, IR-4, SC-5.</p>

               <guidance>
                  <p>This control enhancement is implemented within the remote device (e.g., notebook/laptop computer) via configuration settings that are not configurable by the user of that device. An example of a non-remote communications path from a remote device is a virtual private network. When a non-remote connection is established using a virtual private network, the configuration settings prevent split-tunneling. Split tunneling might otherwise be used by remote users to communicate with the information system as an extension of that system and to communicate with local resources such as a printer or file server. Since the remote device, when connected by a non-remote connection, becomes an extension of the information system, allowing dual communications paths such as split-tunneling would be, in effect, allowing unauthorized external connections into the system.</p>

                  <p>Measures to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of information from the information system include, for example: (i) strict adherence to protocol formats; (ii) monitoring for indications of beaconing from the information system; (iii) monitoring for use of steganography; (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly needed; (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and (vi) employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume or types of traffic expected within the organization. Examples of devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These devices verify adherence to the protocol specification at the application layer and serve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or transport layer.</p>

Another obfuscation technique is to periodically change network addresses.</p>

            <p>This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating-system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection. The time period of inactivity may, as the organization deems necessary, be a set of time periods by type of network access or for specific accesses.</p>

            <p>Decisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the system if used maliciously. Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF, Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on organizational servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations. Policy and procedures related to mobile code, address preventing the development, acquisition, or introduction of unacceptable mobile code within the information system.</p>

A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address resolution service. Digital signatures and cryptographic keys are examples of additional artifacts. DNS resource records are examples of authoritative data. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to assure the authenticity and integrity of response data. The DNS security controls are consistent with, and referenced from, OMB Memorandum 08-23.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides name/address resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS) servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). With regard to role separation, DNS servers with an internal role, only process name/address resolution requests from within the organization (i.e., internal clients). DNS servers with an external role only process name/address resolution information requests from clients external to the organization (i.e., on the external networks including the Internet). The set of clients that can access an authoritative DNS server in a particular role is specified by the organization (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists).</p>

The intent of this control is to establish grounds for confidence at each end of a communications session in the ongoing identity of the other party and in the validity of the information being transmitted. For example, this control addresses man-in-the-middle attacks including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. This control is only implemented where deemed necessary by the organization (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services).</p>

            <p>Failure in a known state can address safety or security in accordance with the mission/business needs of the organization. Failure in a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system. Failure in a known safe state helps prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving information system state information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes.</p>

            <p>This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest in nonmobile devices and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Configurations and/or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and filtering routers and authenticator content are examples of system information likely requiring protection. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate.</p>

         <guidance>
            <p>Information system developers/integrators are in the best position to identify potential avenues within the system that might lead to covert channels. Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when there is the potential for unauthorized information flows across security domains, for example, in the case of information systems containing export-controlled information and having connections to external networks (i.e., networks not controlled by the organization). Covert channel analysis is also meaningful in the case of multilevel secure (MLS) systems, multiple security level (MSL) systems, and cross domain systems.</p>

            <p>Information system partitioning is a part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy. An organizational assessment of risk guides the partitioning of information system components into separate physical domains (or environments). The security categorization also guides the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned information system components. Related controls: AC-4, SC-7.</p>

The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The system and information integrity policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the organization. System and information integrity procedures can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the development of the system and information integrity policy. Related control: PM-9.</p>

            <p>The organization identifies information systems containing software affected by recently announced software flaws (and potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws) and reports this information to designated organizational officials with information security responsibilities (e.g., senior information security officers, information system security managers, information systems security officers). The organization (including any contractor to the organization) promptly installs security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling, are also addressed expeditiously. Organizations are encouraged to use resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational information systems. By requiring that flaw remediation be incorporated into the organizational configuration management process, it is the intent of this control that required/anticipated remediation actions are tracked and verified. An example of expected flaw remediation that would be so verified is whether the procedures contained in US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts have been accomplished. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, MA-2, IR-4, RA-5, SA-11, SI-11.</p>

               <li>Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices on the network to detect and eradicate malicious code: - Transported by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, web accesses, removable media, or other common means; or - Inserted through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities;</li>
               <li>Updates malicious code protection mechanisms (including signature definitions) whenever new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;</li>
               <li>Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to: - Perform periodic scans of the information system [<em>Assignment: organization-defined frequency</em>] and real-time scans of files from external sources as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and - [<em>Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code; send alert to administrator; </em>[<em>Assignment: organization-defined action</em>]] in response to malicious code detection; and</li>
               <li>Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.</li>

            <p>Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, and remote-access servers. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode) or contained within a compressed file. Removable media includes, for example, USB devices, diskettes, or compact disks. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code attacks. Pervasive configuration management and strong software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions and business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms are not built to detect such code. In these situations, organizations must rely instead on other risk mitigation measures to include, for example, secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, configuration management and control, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than those intended.

            <p>Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system (e.g., within internal organizational networks and system components). Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, at selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The Einstein network monitoring device from the Department of Homeland Security is an example of a system monitoring device. The granularity of the information collected is determined by the organization based on its monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to support such activities. An example of a specific type of transaction of interest to the organization with regard to monitoring is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses organizational HTTP proxies, when use of such proxies is required. Related controls: AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, SI-3, SI-7.</p>
