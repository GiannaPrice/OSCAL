                               effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the
                               access control family. The policy and procedures are consistent with applicable federal
                               laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
                               Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for additional specific
                               policies and procedures unnecessary. The access control policy can be included as parstmtt
                               of the general information security policy for the organization. Access control procedures
                               can be developed for the security program in general and for a particular information
                               system, when required. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in the
                               development of the access control policy. Related control: <a class="xref" href="#PM-9">PM-9</a>.

                                         system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, many service-oriented
                                         architecture implementations rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by
                                         dynamic privilege management. While user identities remain relatively constant over
                                         time, user privileges may change more frequently based on the ongoing mission/business
                                         requirements and operational needs of the organization.

                               attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists,
                               access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access
                               between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files,
                               records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system. In addition to enforcing
                               authorized access at the information-system level, access enforcement mechanisms are
                               employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information
                               security for the organization. Consideration is given to the implementation of an audited,
                               explicit override of automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious
                               events. If encryption of stored information is employed as an access enforcement
                               mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant. For classified
                               information, the cryptography used is largely dependent on the classification level of the
                               information and the clearances of the individuals having access to the information.

                               information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access
                               the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A
                               few examples of flow control restrictions include: keeping export controlled information
                               from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims
                               to be from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that
                               are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement
                               mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information
                               between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within
                               information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the
                               characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific examples of flow
                               control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways,
                               guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish
                               configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a
                               packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability
                               based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics). Mechanisms

                                         (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce unitary information flow directions; and
                                         (iii) implementing fully tested, re-grading mechanisms to reassign security attributes
                                         and associated security labels.

                               of the temporary nature of the absence. The session lock is implemented at the point where
                               session activity can be determined. This is typically at the operating system-level, but
                               may be at the application-level. A session lock is not a substitute for logging out of the
                               information system, for example, if the organization requires users to log out at the end
                               of the workday.

                               allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypass may be, for

                               of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information. These
                               attributes are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers,
                               files) within the information system and are used to enable the implementation of access

                               control. Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or
                               process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an external network (e.g., the

                               <a class="xref" href="#AC-18">AC-18</a> for wireless access). A virtual private network when adequately provisioned with
                               appropriate security controls, is considered an internal network (i.e., the organization
                               establishes a network connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a manner
                               that does not require the organization to depend on external networks to protect the
                               confidentiality or integrity of information transmitted across the network). Remote access

                  <p class="p">External information systems are information systems or components of information systems
                               that are outside of the authorization boundary established by the organization and for
                               which the organization typically has no direct supervision and authority over the
                               application of required security controls or the assessment of security control
                               effectiveness. External information systems include, but are not limited to: (i)
                               personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, or personal
                               digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in
                               commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports); (iii)
                               information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv)
                               federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct
                               supervision and authority of the organization. For some external systems, in particular
                               those systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to
                               those agencies, the trust relationships that have been established between those
                               organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and
                               conditions are required. In effect, the information systems of these organizations would
                               not be considered external. These situations typically occur when, for example, there is
                               some pre-existing sharing or trust agreement (either implicit or explicit) established
                               between federal agencies and/or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or such trust
                               agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies.
                               Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other
                               individuals with authorized access to the organizational information system and over which
                               the organization has the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system
                               access. The restrictions that an organization imposes on authorized individuals need not
                               be uniform, as those restrictions are likely to vary depending upon the trust
                               relationships between organizations. Thus, an organization might impose more stringent
                               security restrictions on a contractor than on a state, local, or tribal government.

                  <p class="p">The purpose of this control is for the organization to identify events which need to be
                               auditable as significant and relevant to the security of the information system; giving an
                               overall system requirement in order to meet ongoing and specific audit needs. To balance
                               auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires
                               identifying that subset of auditable events that are to be audited at a given point in
                               time. For example, the organization may determine that the information system must have
                               the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate
                               that capability except for specific circumstances due to the extreme burden on system
                               performance. In addition, audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction,
                               including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the right
                               level of abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit
                               capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Related

                                         performing audit activity on a separate information system or by using storage media

                  <p class="p">The organization assesses the security controls in an information system as part of: (i)
                               security authorization or reauthorization; (ii) meeting the FISMA requirement for annual
                               assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) testing/evaluation of the information
                               system as part of the system development life cycle process. The assessment report
                               documents the assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the
                               organization, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the report and whether the
                               security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
                               desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements of the information
                               system. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security control assessments should
                               not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional assessment requirements to those
                               requirements already in place in the security authorization process. To satisfy the FISMA
                               annual assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control assessment
                               results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) assessments
                               conducted as part of an information system authorization or reauthorization process; (ii)
                               continuous monitoring (see <a class="xref" href="#CA-7">CA-7</a>); or (iii) testing and evaluation of an information system
                               as part of the ongoing system development life cycle (provided that the testing and
                               evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control
                               effectiveness). Existing security control assessment results are reused to the extent that
                               they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed.

                               criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls within the information
                               system and its environment of operation for assessment. Those security controls that are
                               the most volatile (i.e., controls most affected by ongoing changes to the information
                               system or its environment of operation) or deemed critical by the organization to

                               results from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment requirement

                        <p class="p">An independent assessor or assessment team is any individual or group capable of
                                         conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational information system.
                                         Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual
                                         conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or
                                         management chain associated with the information system or to the determination of
                                         security control effectiveness. Independent security assessment services can be
                                         obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public
                                         or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted assessment services
                                         are considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in
                                         the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of the assessor or
                                         assessment team conducting the assessment of the security controls in the information
                                         system. The authorizing official determines the required level of assessor
                                         independence based on the security categorization of the information system and/or the
                                         ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, and to individuals. The
                                         authorizing official determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to
                                         provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to
                                         make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for example when the
                                         organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure
                                         requires that the assessment be accomplished by individuals that are in the
                                         developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner, independence
                                         in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are
                                         carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the
                                         completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.

                        <p class="p">Penetration testing exercises both physical and technical security controls. A
                                         standard method for penetration testing consists of: (i) pretest analysis based on
                                         full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential
                                         vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine
                                         exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. Detailed rules of engagement are agreed
                                         upon by all parties before the commencement of any penetration testing scenario. These
                                         rules of engagement are correlated with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are
                                         anticipated to be employed by threat-sources in carrying out attacks. An
                                         organizational assessment of risk guides the decision on the level of independence
                                         required for penetration agents or penetration teams conducting penetration testing.
                                         Red team exercises are conducted as a simulated adversarial attempt to compromise
                                         organizational missions and/or business processes to provide a comprehensive
                                         assessment of the security capability of the information system and organization.
                                         While penetration testing may be laboratory-based testing, red team exercises are
                                         intended to be more comprehensive in nature and reflect real-world conditions.
                                         Information system monitoring, malicious user testing, penetration testing, red-team
                                         exercises, and other forms of security testing (e.g., independent verification and
                                         validation) are conducted to improve the readiness of the organization by exercising
                                         organizational capabilities and indicating current performance levels as a means of

                                         organization. Testing is conducted in accordance with applicable federal laws,
                                         Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Testing methods
                                         are approved by authorizing officials in coordination with the organizations Risk

                               organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced when information systems
                               are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls,
                               both within the organization and external to the organization. Authorizing officials
                               determine the risk associated with each connection and the appropriate controls employed.
                               If the interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, an Interconnection
                               Security Agreement is not required. Rather, the interface characteristics between the
                               interconnecting information systems are described in the security plans for the respective
                               systems. If the interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials but the
                               authorizing officials are in the same organization, the organization determines whether an
                               Interconnection Security Agreement is required, or alternatively, the interface
                               characteristics between systems are described in the security plans of the respective
                               systems. Instead of developing an Interconnection Security Agreement, organizations may
                               choose to incorporate this information into a formal contract, especially if the

                               sector) organization. In every case, documenting the interface characteristics is
                               required, yet the formality and approval process vary considerably even though all
                               accomplish the same fundamental objective of managing the risk being incurred by the
                               interconnection of the information systems. Risk considerations also include information

                  <p class="p">Security authorization is the official management decision, conveyed through the
                               authorization decision document, given by a senior organizational official or executive
                               (i.e., authorizing official) to authorize operation of an information system and to
                               explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
                               organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of
                               security controls. Authorizing officials typically have budgetary oversight for
                               information systems or are responsible for the mission or business operations supported by
                               the systems. Security authorization is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore,
                               authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization
                               process, authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with
                               information system operations. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management
                               positions with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such
                               information system-related security risks. Through the employment of a comprehensive
                               continuous monitoring process, the critical information contained in the authorization
                               package (i.e., the security plan (including risk assessment), the security assessment
                               report, and the plan of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing
                               the authorizing official and the information system owner with an up-to-date status of the
                               security state of the information system. To reduce the administrative cost of security
                               reauthorization, the authorizing official uses the results of the continuous monitoring
                               process to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering a reauthorization
                               decision. OMB policy requires that federal information systems are reauthorized at least
                               every three years or when there is a significant change to the system. The organization
                               defines what constitutes a significant change to the information system. Related controls:

                  <p class="p">A continuous monitoring program allows an organization to maintain the security
                               authorization of an information system over time in a highly dynamic environment of
                               operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business
                               processes. Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools
                               facilitates near real-time risk management and promotes organizational situational
                               awareness with regard to the security state of the information system. The implementation
                               of a continuous monitoring program results in ongoing updates to the security plan, the
                               security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones, the three principal
                               documents in the security authorization package. A rigorous and well executed continuous
                               monitoring program significantly reduces the level of effort required for the
                               reauthorization of the information system. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in
                               accordance with the security categorization of the information system. Related controls:

                               configuration controlled. Configuration change control for the information system involves
                               the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, test/evaluation, review, and
                               disposition of changes to the system, including upgrades and modifications. Configuration
                               change control includes changes to components of the information system, changes to the
                               configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems,
                               applications, firewalls, routers), emergency changes, and changes to remediate flaws. A
                               typical organizational process for managing configuration changes to the information
                               system includes, for example, a chartered Configuration Control Board that approves
                               proposed changes to the system. Auditing of changes refers to changes in activity before
                               and after a change is made to the information system and the auditing activities required
                               to implement the change. Related controls: <a class="xref" href="#CM-4">CM-4</a>, <a class="xref" href="#CM-5">CM-5</a>, <a class="xref" href="#CM-6">CM-6</a>, <a class="xref" href="#SI-2">SI-2</a>.

                               system can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system.
                               Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals are allowed to obtain access to
                               information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and
                               modifications. Additionally, maintaining records of access is essential for ensuring that
                               configuration change control is being implemented as intended and for supporting
                               after-the-fact actions should the organization become aware of an unauthorized change to
                               the information system. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries.
                               Examples of access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls
                               (see <a class="xref" href="#AC-3">AC-3</a> and <a class="xref" href="#PE-3">PE-3</a>), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes
                               are implemented into a third-party interface rather than directly into the information
                               system component), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times,
                               making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). Some or all of the
                               enforcement mechanisms and processes necessary to implement this security control are
                               included in other controls. For measures implemented in other controls, this control
                               provides information to be used in the implementation of the other controls to cover
                               specific needs related to enforcing authorizations to make changes to the information
                               system, auditing changes, and retaining and review records of changes. Related controls:

                  <p class="p">Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information
                               technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters
                               are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters
                               related to meeting other security control requirements. Security-related parameters
                               include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and directory settings (i.e.,
                               permissions); and settings for services, ports, protocols, and remote connections.
                               Organizations establish organization-wide mandatory configuration settings from which the
                               settings for a given information system are derived. A security configuration checklist
                               (sometimes referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, security guide, security
                               technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark) is a series of instructions or
                               procedures for configuring an information system component to meet operational
                               requirements. Checklists can be developed by information technology developers and
                               vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies (and other government
                               organizations), and others in the public and private sectors. An example of a security
                               configuration checklist is the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) which potentially
                               affects the implementation of <a class="xref" href="#CM-6">CM-6</a> and other controls such as <a class="xref" href="#AC-19">AC-19</a> and <a class="xref" href="#CM-7">CM-7</a>. The Security
                               Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common
                               Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and
                               control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration

                               Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support
                               essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is
                               sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an
                               information system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any
                               one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single
                               function per device (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and
                               services provided by organizational information systems, or individual components of
                               information systems, are carefully reviewed to determine which functions and services are
                               candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging,
                               auto-execute, file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary
                               physical and logical ports and protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus [USB], File Transfer
                               Protocol [FTP], Internet Protocol Version 6 [IPv6], Hyper Text Transfer Protocol [HTTP])
                               on information system components to prevent unauthorized connection of devices,
                               unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize
                               network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point
                               protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and
                               prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. Related control:

                  <p class="p">Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational program
                               for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business operations. Contingency
                               planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative
                               mission/business processes when systems are compromised. Information system recovery
                               objectives are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
                               standards, or regulations. In addition to information system availability, contingency
                               plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in
                               mission/business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality
                               or integrity of the information system. Examples of actions to call out in contingency
                               plans include, for example, graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back
                               to a manual mode, alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved
                               solely for when the system is under attack. Related controls: <a class="xref" href="#AC-14">AC-14</a>, <a class="xref" href="#CP-6">CP-6</a>, <a class="xref" href="#CP-7">CP-7</a>, <a class="xref" href="#CP-8">CP-8</a>,

                  <p class="p">Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization
                               deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers,
                               individuals from allied nations). Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all
                               accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the
                               organization in <a class="xref" href="#AC-14">AC-14</a>. Unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g.,
                               shared privilege accounts) may need to be considered for detailed accountability of
                               activity. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords,
                               tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination
                               thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local or
                               network. Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or
                               process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained by direct connection
                               without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an organizational
                               information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is
                               obtained through a network connection. Remote access is a type of network access which
                               involves communication through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks
                               include local area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks that are
                               under the control of the organization. For a virtual private network (VPN), the VPN is
                               considered an internal network if the organization establishes the VPN connection between
                               organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to
                               depend on any external networks across which the VPN transits to protect the
                               confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted. Identification and
                               authentication requirements for information system access by other than organizational
                               users are described in <a class="xref" href="#IA-8">IA-8</a>.

                  <p class="p">The identification and authentication requirements in this control are satisfied by
                               complying with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with
                               organization-specific implementation plans provided to OMB. In addition to identifying and
                               authenticating users at the information-system level (i.e., at logon), identification and
                               authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to
                               provide increased information security for the organization. Related controls: <a class="xref" href="#AC-14">AC-14</a>,

                                         employ static information system accounts for preregistered users, many
                                         service-oriented architecture implementations rely on establishing identities at run
                                         time for entities that were previously unknown. Dynamic establishment of identities
                                         and association of attributes and privileges with these identities is anticipated and
                                         provisioned. Pre-established trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate
                                         authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential.

                  <p class="p">User authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI
                               certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g.,
                               the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g.,
                               minimum password length). Many information system components are shipped with factory
                               default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration.
                               Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, present a
                               significant security risk, and therefore, are changed upon installation. The requirement
                               to protect user authenticators may be implemented via control <a class="xref" href="#PL-4">PL-4</a> or <a class="xref" href="#PS-6">PS-6</a> for

                               authenticators stored within the information system (e.g., passwords stored in a hashed or
                               encrypted format, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible only with
                               super user privileges). The information system supports user authenticator management by
                               organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics
                               including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time
                               window for time synchronous one time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during
                               verification stage of biometric authentication. Measures to safeguard user authenticators
                               include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or
                               sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators
                               immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer
                               needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance.
                               Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords. Related controls:

                               security attributes. The term labeling is used when referring to the application or use of
                               security attributes with regard to internal data structures within the information system
                               (see <a class="xref" href="#AC-16">AC-16</a>, Security Attributes). Removable information system media includes both digital
                               media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb
                               drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-digital media (e.g., paper,
                               microfilm). An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media requiring
                               marking. Marking is generally not required for media containing information determined by
                               the organization to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. Some
                               organizations, however, may require markings for public information indicating that the
                               information is publicly releasable. Organizations may extend the scope of this control to
                               include information system output devices containing organizational information,
                               including, for example, monitors and printers. Marking of removable media and information
                               system output is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
                               policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

                  <p class="p">Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes,
                               removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and
                               non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to mobile computing
                               and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop
                               computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital cameras, and audio
                               recording devices) that are transported outside of controlled areas. Telephone systems are
                               also considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on
                               internal media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most
                               cases, the identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically
                               employed in other information systems, organizational personnel use caution in the types
                               of information stored on telephone voicemail systems that are transported outside of
                               controlled areas. A controlled area is any area or space for which the organization has
                               confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to meet
                               the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system.

                               media are commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information residing
                               on the media, and consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
                               policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Locked containers and cryptography are
                               examples of security measures available to protect digital and non-digital media during
                               transport. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and/or integrity
                               protections depending upon the mechanisms used. An organizational assessment of risk
                               guides: (i) the selection of media and associated information contained on that media
                               requiring protection during transport; and (ii) the selection and use of storage
                               containers for transporting non-digital media. Authorized transport and courier personnel
                               may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a

                                         information systems. Many of these devices are obtained from unknown sources and may
                                         contain various types of malicious code that can be readily transferred to the
                                         information system through USB ports or other entry portals. While scanning such
                                         devices is always recommended, sanitization provides additional assurance that the
                                         device is free of all malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day
                                         attacks. Organizations consider sanitization of portable, removable storage devices,
                                         for example, when such devices are first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor
                                         prior to initial use or when the organization loses a positive chain of custody for
                                         the device. An organizational assessment of risk guides the specific circumstances for
                                         employing the sanitization process. Related control: <a class="xref" href="#SI-3">SI-3</a>.

                  <p class="p">The information security program plan can be represented in a single document or
                               compilation of documents at the discretion of the organization. The plan documents the
                               organization-wide program management controls and organization-defined common controls.
                               The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide
                               information security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security
                               controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix
                               to the organizations information security program plan unless the controls are included in
                               a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as
                               part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary protection
                               inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide
                               information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain
                               descriptions of common controls.

                  <p class="p">Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in
                               multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common
                               controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the
                               information security program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies
                               in each document the organizational official or officials responsible for the development,
                               implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common
                               controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management Office
                               develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and
                               environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated
                               with a particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems.

                               assessment. Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and
                               security controls planned or in place to determine the level of residual risk posed to
                               organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
                               based on the operation of the information system. Risk assessments also take into account

                               external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on

                               feasible, given the current state of the hardware, software, and firmware within the
                               system. Examples of security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing
                               layered protections; (ii) establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls
                               as the foundation for design; (iii) incorporating security into the system development
                               life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring system
                               developers and integrators are trained on how to develop secure software; (vi) tailoring
                               security controls to meet organizational and operational needs; and (vii) reducing risk to
                               acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.

                  <p class="p">An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the
                               authorization boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is
                               used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with
                               external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through
                               joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., contracts,
                               interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or
                               supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for adequately mitigating risks arising from
                               the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official.
                               Authorizing officials require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with
                               external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information
                               security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires that the
                               organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider
                               in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for
                               the services rendered to the organization. The extent and nature of this chain of trust
                               varies based on the relationship between the organization and the external provider. Where
                               a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service
                               providers, the organization employs compensating security controls or accepts the greater
                               degree of risk. The external information system services documentation includes
                               government, service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any
                               service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance
                               for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies
                               and response requirements for any identified instance of noncompliance.

                  <p class="p">The intent of this control is to ensure that organizations recognize the importance of
                               trustworthiness and making explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing, developing,
                               and implementing organizational information systems. Trustworthiness is a characteristic
                               or property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be
                               expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information
                               being processed, stored, or transmitted by the system. Trustworthy information systems are
                               systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite
                               the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to
                               occur in the specified environments of operation. Two factors affecting the
                               trustworthiness of an information system include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the
                               security features or functions employed within the system); and (ii) security assurance
                               (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its
                               application). 
                  </p>
                          
                  <p class="p">Appropriate security functionality for the information system can be obtained by using
                               the Risk Management Framework (Steps 1, 2, and 3) to select and implement the necessary
                               management, operational, and technical security controls necessary to mitigate risk to
                               organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
                               Appropriate security assurance can be obtained by: (i) the actions taken by developers and
                               implementers of security controls with regard to the design, development, implementation,
                               and operation of those controls; and (ii) the actions taken by assessors to determine the
                               extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
                               producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
                               information system. 
                  </p>
                          
                  <p class="p">Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security controls by employing
                               well-defined security policy models, structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and
                               software development techniques, and sound system/security engineering principles.
                               Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the initiation,
                               acquisition/development, implementation, and operations/maintenance phases of the system
                               development life cycle. For example, developmental evidence may include the techniques and
                               methods used to design and develop security functionality. Operational evidence may
                               include flaw reporting and remediation, the results of security incident reporting, and
                               the results of the ongoing monitoring of security controls. Independent assessments by
                               qualified assessors may include analyses of the evidence as well as testing, inspections,
                               and audits. Minimum assurance requirements are described in Appendix E. 
                  </p>
                          
                  <p class="p">Explicit trustworthiness decisions highlight situations where achieving the information
                               system resilience and security capability necessary to withstand cyber attacks from
                               adversaries with certain threat capabilities may require adjusting the risk management
                               strategy, the design of mission/business processes with regard to automation, the
                               selection and implementation rigor of management and operational protections, or the
                               selection of information technology components with higher levels of trustworthiness.
                               Trustworthiness may be defined on a component-by-component, subsystem-by-subsystem, or
                               function-by-function basis. It is noted, however, that typically functions, subsystems,
                               and components are highly interrelated, making separation by trustworthiness perhaps
                               problematic and at a minimum, something that likely requires careful attention in order to
                               achieve practically useful results. Related controls: <a class="xref" href="#RA-2">RA-2</a>, <a class="xref" href="#SA-4">SA-4</a>, <a class="xref" href="#SA-8">SA-8</a>, <a class="xref" href="#SC-3">SC-3</a>.

                               and guidance. Existing organizational policies and procedures may make the need for

                  <p class="p">Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions necessary to
                               administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires
                               privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information system
                               management functionality is either physical or logical and is accomplished by using
                               different computers, different central processing units, different instances of the
                               operating system, different network addresses, combinations of these methods, or other
                               methods as appropriate. An example of this type of separation is observed in web
                               administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other
                               information system resources. This may include isolating the administrative interface on a
                               different domain and with additional access controls.

                               directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth

                                         user of that device. An example of a non-remote communications path from a remote
                                         device is a virtual private network. When a non-remote connection is established using
                                         a virtual private network, the configuration settings prevent split-tunneling. Split
                                         tunneling might otherwise be used by remote users to communicate with the information
                                         system as an extension of that system and to communicate with local resources such as
                                         a printer or file server. Since the remote device, when connected by a non-remote
                                         connection, becomes an extension of the information system, allowing dual
                                         communications paths such as split-tunneling would be, in effect, allowing

                  <p class="p">A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that provides
                               name/address resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to enhance
                               redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS)
                               servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two
                               servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated
                               (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). With regard to role separation, DNS
                               servers with an internal role, only process name/address resolution requests from within
                               the organization (i.e., internal clients). DNS servers with an external role only process
                               name/address resolution information requests from clients external to the organization
                               (i.e., on the external networks including the Internet). The set of clients that can
                               access an authoritative DNS server in a particular role is specified by the organization
                               (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists).

                               responsibilities (e.g., senior information security officers, information system security
                               managers, information systems security officers). The organization (including any
                               contractor to the organization) promptly installs security-relevant software updates
                               (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security
                               assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system
                               error handling, are also addressed expeditiously. Organizations are encouraged to use
                               resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and
                               Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational information
                               systems. By requiring that flaw remediation be incorporated into the organizational
                               configuration management process, it is the intent of this control that
                               required/anticipated remediation actions are tracked and verified. An example of expected
                               flaw remediation that would be so verified is whether the procedures contained in US-CERT
                               guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts have been accomplished. Related

                  <p class="p">Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail
                               servers, web servers, proxy servers, and remote-access servers. Malicious code includes,
                               for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be
                               encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode) or contained within a compressed
                               file. Removable media includes, for example, USB devices, diskettes, or compact disks. A
                               variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious
                               code attacks. Pervasive configuration management and strong software integrity controls
                               may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
                               off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This
                               could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that
                               could affect organizational missions and business functions. Traditional malicious code
                               protection mechanisms are not built to detect such code. In these situations,
                               organizations must rely instead on other risk mitigation measures to include, for example,
                               secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, configuration management and
                               control, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions
                               other than those intended.

                               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part
                               of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the

                               networks and system components). Information system monitoring capability is achieved
                               through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion
                               prevention systems, malicious code protection software, audit record monitoring software,
                               network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for
                               example, at selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical
                               applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces

                               granularity of the information collected is determined by the organization based on its
                               monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to support such
                               activities. An example of a specific type of transaction of interest to the organization
                               with regard to monitoring is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses
