          between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files,
          records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system. In addition to enforcing
          authorized access at the information-system level, access enforcement mechanisms are
          employed at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information
          security for the organization. Consideration is given to the implementation of an audited,
          explicit override of automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious
          events. If encryption of stored information is employed as an access enforcement
          mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant. For classified

              which the user is authorized access based on classification of the information, and on
              user clearance and formal access authorization. The information system assigns
              appropriate security attributes (e.g., labels/security domains/types) to subjects and
              objects, and uses these attributes as the basis for MAC decisions. The Bell-LaPadula
              security model defines allowed access with regard to an organization-defined set of
              strictly hierarchical security levels as follows: A subject can read an object only if
              the security level of the subject dominates the security level of the object and a
              subject can write to an object only if two conditions are met: the security level of

          few examples of flow control restrictions include: keeping export controlled information

          to be from within the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that
          are not from the internal web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement

          between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within
          information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the
          characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific examples of flow
          control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways,
          guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish

        <p>Mobile devices include portable storage media (e.g., USB memory sticks, external hard
          disk drives) and portable computing and communications devices with information storage
          capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular
          telephones, digital cameras, and audio recording devices). Organization-controlled mobile
          devices include those devices for which the organization has the authority to specify and
          the ability to enforce specific security requirements. Usage restrictions and
          implementation guidance related to mobile devices include, for example, configuration
          management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory
          protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for
          malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates
          and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software)
          integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Examples
          of information system functionality that provide the capability for automatic execution of
          code are AutoRun and AutoPlay. </p>
        <p>Organizational policies and procedures for mobile devices used by individuals departing
          on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are of
          concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are
          configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific measures to the
          device after travel is completed. Specially configured mobile devices include, for
          example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional
          hardening (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified measures applied to
          mobile devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for
          signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting
          information residing on mobile devices is covered in the media protection family. Related

        <p>The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust
          relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining
          external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Access the information system from the external information systems; and</li>
          <li>Process, store, and/or transmit organization-controlled information using the external
            information systems.</li>
        </ol>
      </desc>
      <stmt name="supplemental-guidance">
        <p>External information systems are information systems or components of information systems
          that are outside of the authorization boundary established by the organization and for
          which the organization typically has no direct supervision and authority over the
          application of required security controls or the assessment of security control
          effectiveness. External information systems include, but are not limited to: (i)
          personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular telephones, or personal
          digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in
          commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports); (iii)
          information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv)
          federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct
          supervision and authority of the organization. For some external systems, in particular
          those systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to
          those agencies, the trust relationships that have been established between those
          organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and
          conditions are required. In effect, the information systems of these organizations would
          not be considered external. These situations typically occur when, for example, there is
          some pre-existing sharing or trust agreement (either implicit or explicit) established
          between federal agencies and/or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or such trust
          agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies.
          Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other
          individuals with authorized access to the organizational information system and over which
          the organization has the authority to impose rules of behavior with regard to system
          access. The restrictions that an organization imposes on authorized individuals need not
          be uniform, as those restrictions are likely to vary depending upon the trust
          relationships between organizations. Thus, an organization might impose more stringent
          security restrictions on a contractor than on a state, local, or tribal government. </p>
        <p>This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public
          interfaces to organizational information systems and information (e.g., individuals
          accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). The organization establishes terms and
          conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational
          security policies and procedures. The terms and conditions address as a minimum; (i) the
          types of applications that can be accessed on the organizational information system from
          the external information system; and (ii) the maximum security categorization of
          information that can be processed, stored, and transmitted on the external information
          system. This control defines access authorizations enforced by AC-3, rules of behavior
          requirements enforced by PL-4, and session establishment rules enforced by AC-17. Related

        <p>The purpose of this control is for the organization to identify events which need to be

          overall system requirement in order to meet ongoing and specific audit needs. To balance

          identifying that subset of auditable events that are to be audited at a given point in
          time. For example, the organization may determine that the information system must have
          the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate
          that capability except for specific circumstances due to the extreme burden on system
          performance. In addition, audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction,

        <p>The organization assesses the security controls in an information system as part of: (i)
          security authorization or reauthorization; (ii) meeting the FISMA requirement for annual
          assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) testing/evaluation of the information
          system as part of the system development life cycle process. The assessment report
          documents the assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the
          organization, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the report and whether the
          security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
          desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements of the information
          system. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security control assessments should
          not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional assessment requirements to those
          requirements already in place in the security authorization process. To satisfy the FISMA
          annual assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control assessment
          results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) assessments
          conducted as part of an information system authorization or reauthorization process; (ii)
          continuous monitoring (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of an information system
          as part of the ongoing system development life cycle (provided that the testing and
          evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control
          effectiveness). Existing security control assessment results are reused to the extent that
          they are still valid and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. </p>
        <p>Subsequent to the initial authorization of the information system and in accordance with
          OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of the security controls annually during
          continuous monitoring. The organization establishes the security control selection
          criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls within the information
          system and its environment of operation for assessment. Those security controls that are
          the most volatile (i.e., controls most affected by ongoing changes to the information
          system or its environment of operation) or deemed critical by the organization to
          protecting organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
          Nation are assessed more frequently in accordance with an organizational assessment of
          risk. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information systems
          three-year authorization cycle. The organization can use the current years assessment
          results from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment requirement
          provided that the results are current, valid, and relevant to determining security control
          effectiveness. External audits (e.g., audits conducted by external entities such as
          regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control. Related controls: CA-6, CA-7,

            <p>The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to conduct an

          <stmt name="supplemental-guidance">
            <p>An independent assessor or assessment team is any individual or group capable of
              conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational information system.
              Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual
              conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or
              management chain associated with the information system or to the determination of
              security control effectiveness. Independent security assessment services can be
              obtained from other elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public
              or private sector entity outside of the organization. Contracted assessment services
              are considered independent if the information system owner is not directly involved in
              the contracting process or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of the assessor or
              assessment team conducting the assessment of the security controls in the information
              system. The authorizing official determines the required level of assessor
              independence based on the security categorization of the information system and/or the
              ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, and to individuals. The
              authorizing official determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to
              provide confidence that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to
              make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for example when the
              organization that owns the information system is small or the organizational structure
              requires that the assessment be accomplished by individuals that are in the
              developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the system owner, independence
              in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the assessment results are
              carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to validate the
              completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.</p>

            <p>Penetration testing exercises both physical and technical security controls. A
              standard method for penetration testing consists of: (i) pretest analysis based on
              full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential
              vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine
              exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. Detailed rules of engagement are agreed
              upon by all parties before the commencement of any penetration testing scenario. These
              rules of engagement are correlated with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are
              anticipated to be employed by threat-sources in carrying out attacks. An
              organizational assessment of risk guides the decision on the level of independence
              required for penetration agents or penetration teams conducting penetration testing.
              Red team exercises are conducted as a simulated adversarial attempt to compromise
              organizational missions and/or business processes to provide a comprehensive
              assessment of the security capability of the information system and organization.
              While penetration testing may be laboratory-based testing, red team exercises are
              intended to be more comprehensive in nature and reflect real-world conditions.
              Information system monitoring, malicious user testing, penetration testing, red-team
              exercises, and other forms of security testing (e.g., independent verification and
              validation) are conducted to improve the readiness of the organization by exercising
              organizational capabilities and indicating current performance levels as a means of
              focusing organizational actions to improve the security state of the system and
              organization. Testing is conducted in accordance with applicable federal laws,
              Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Testing methods
              are approved by authorizing officials in coordination with the organizations Risk
              Executive Function. Vulnerabilities uncovered during red team exercises are
              incorporated into the vulnerability remediation process. Related controls: RA-5,

        <p>This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems and does not
          apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as email and website browsing. The
          organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced when information systems
          are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls,
          both within the organization and external to the organization. Authorizing officials
          determine the risk associated with each connection and the appropriate controls employed.
          If the interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, an Interconnection
          Security Agreement is not required. Rather, the interface characteristics between the
          interconnecting information systems are described in the security plans for the respective
          systems. If the interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials but the
          authorizing officials are in the same organization, the organization determines whether an
          Interconnection Security Agreement is required, or alternatively, the interface
          characteristics between systems are described in the security plans of the respective
          systems. Instead of developing an Interconnection Security Agreement, organizations may
          choose to incorporate this information into a formal contract, especially if the
          interconnection is to be established between a federal agency and a nonfederal (private
          sector) organization. In every case, documenting the interface characteristics is

          interconnection of the information systems. Risk considerations also include information

        <p>Security authorization is the official management decision, conveyed through the
          authorization decision document, given by a senior organizational official or executive
          (i.e., authorizing official) to authorize operation of an information system and to
          explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
          organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of
          security controls. Authorizing officials typically have budgetary oversight for
          information systems or are responsible for the mission or business operations supported by
          the systems. Security authorization is an inherently federal responsibility and therefore,
          authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security authorization
          process, authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with
          information system operations. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management
          positions with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such
          information system-related security risks. Through the employment of a comprehensive
          continuous monitoring process, the critical information contained in the authorization
          package (i.e., the security plan (including risk assessment), the security assessment
          report, and the plan of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing
          the authorizing official and the information system owner with an up-to-date status of the
          security state of the information system. To reduce the administrative cost of security
          reauthorization, the authorizing official uses the results of the continuous monitoring
          process to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering a reauthorization
          decision. OMB policy requires that federal information systems are reauthorized at least
          every three years or when there is a significant change to the system. The organization
          defines what constitutes a significant change to the information system. Related controls:

        <p>A continuous monitoring program allows an organization to maintain the security
          authorization of an information system over time in a highly dynamic environment of
          operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business
          processes. Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools
          facilitates near real-time risk management and promotes organizational situational
          awareness with regard to the security state of the information system. The implementation
          of a continuous monitoring program results in ongoing updates to the security plan, the
          security assessment report, and the plan of action and milestones, the three principal
          documents in the security authorization package. A rigorous and well executed continuous
          monitoring program significantly reduces the level of effort required for the

        <p>Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the information
          system can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the system.
          Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals are allowed to obtain access to
          information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and
          modifications. Additionally, maintaining records of access is essential for ensuring that
          configuration change control is being implemented as intended and for supporting
          after-the-fact actions should the organization become aware of an unauthorized change to
          the information system. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries.
          Examples of access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls
          (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes
          are implemented into a third-party interface rather than directly into the information
          system component), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times,
          making unauthorized changes outside the window easy to discover). Some or all of the
          enforcement mechanisms and processes necessary to implement this security control are
          included in other controls. For measures implemented in other controls, this control
          provides information to be used in the implementation of the other controls to cover
          specific needs related to enforcing authorizations to make changes to the information
          system, auditing changes, and retaining and review records of changes. Related controls:

        <p>Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information
          technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters
          are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters
          related to meeting other security control requirements. Security-related parameters
          include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and directory settings (i.e.,
          permissions); and settings for services, ports, protocols, and remote connections.
          Organizations establish organization-wide mandatory configuration settings from which the
          settings for a given information system are derived. A security configuration checklist
          (sometimes referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening guide, security guide, security
          technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark) is a series of instructions or
          procedures for configuring an information system component to meet operational
          requirements. Checklists can be developed by information technology developers and
          vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies (and other government
          organizations), and others in the public and private sectors. An example of a security
          configuration checklist is the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) which potentially
          affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security
          Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common
          Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and
          control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration

          Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support

          one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single
          function per device (e.g., email server or web server, not both). The functions and
          services provided by organizational information systems, or individual components of

        <p>Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational program
          for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business operations. Contingency
          planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative
          mission/business processes when systems are compromised. Information system recovery
          objectives are consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
          standards, or regulations. In addition to information system availability, contingency
          plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in
          mission/business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality
          or integrity of the information system. Examples of actions to call out in contingency
          plans include, for example, graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back
          to a manual mode, alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved
          solely for when the system is under attack. Related controls: AC-14, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8,

        <p>The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or
          processes acting on behalf of organizational users).</p>
      </desc>
      <stmt name="supplemental-guidance">
        <p>Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization
          deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers,
          individuals from allied nations). Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all
          accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the
          organization in AC-14. Unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g.,
          shared privilege accounts) may need to be considered for detailed accountability of
          activity. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords,
          tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination
          thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local or
          network. Local access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or
          process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained by direct connection
          without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an organizational
          information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is
          obtained through a network connection. Remote access is a type of network access which
          involves communication through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks
          include local area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks that are
          under the control of the organization. For a virtual private network (VPN), the VPN is
          considered an internal network if the organization establishes the VPN connection between
          organization-controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to
          depend on any external networks across which the VPN transits to protect the
          confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted. Identification and
          authentication requirements for information system access by other than organizational
          users are described in IA-8. </p>
        <p>The identification and authentication requirements in this control are satisfied by
          complying with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with
          organization-specific implementation plans provided to OMB. In addition to identifying and
          authenticating users at the information-system level (i.e., at logon), identification and
          authentication mechanisms are employed at the application level, when necessary, to
          provide increased information security for the organization. Related controls: AC-14,
          AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5.</p>

          Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, present a
          significant security risk, and therefore, are changed upon installation. The requirement
          to protect user authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for
          authenticators in the possession of users and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for
          authenticators stored within the information system (e.g., passwords stored in a hashed or
          encrypted format, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible only with
          super user privileges). The information system supports user authenticator management by
          organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics
          including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time
          window for time synchronous one time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during
          verification stage of biometric authentication. Measures to safeguard user authenticators
          include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or
          sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators
          immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer
          needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance.
          Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords. Related controls:
          AC-2, IA-2, PL-4, PS-6.</p>

        <p>Non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by
          individuals communicating through a network; either an external network (e.g., the

          activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or
          information system component and not communicating across a network connection.
          Identification and authentication techniques used in the establishment of non-local

        <p>Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes, magnetic tapes,
          external/removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks)
          and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This control also applies to mobile
          computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
          notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, digital
          cameras, and audio recording devices). Telephone systems are also considered information
          systems and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on
          voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the
          identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other
          information systems, organizational personnel use extreme caution in the types of
          information stored on telephone voicemail systems. A controlled area is any area or space
          for which the organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections are
          sufficient to meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or
          information system. </p>
        <p>An organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated
          information contained on that media requiring physical protection. Fewer protection
          measures are needed for media containing information determined by the organization to be
          in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact
          on the organization or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel. In
          these situations, it is assumed that the physical access controls to the facility where
          the media resides provide adequate protection. </p>
        <p>As part of a defense-in-depth strategy, the organization considers routinely encrypting
          information at rest on selected secondary storage devices. The employment of cryptography
          is at the discretion of the information owner/steward. The selection of the cryptographic
          mechanisms used is based upon maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the
          information. The strength of mechanisms is commensurate with the classification and
          sensitivity of the information. Related controls: AC-3, AC-19, CP-6, CP-9, MP-2, PE-3.</p>

          a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as
          part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary protection
          inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide
          information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain
          descriptions of common controls. </p>
        <p>Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in
          multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common
          controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the
          information security program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies
          in each document the organizational official or officials responsible for the development,
          implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common
          controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management Office
          develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and
          environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated
          with a particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems.

        <p>A clearly defined authorization boundary is a prerequisite for an effective risk
          assessment. Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and
          security controls planned or in place to determine the level of residual risk posed to
          organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
          based on the operation of the information system. Risk assessments also take into account
          risk posed to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals from
          external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on
          behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems,
          outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication
          initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also
          be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational
          assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems. The General
          Services Administration provides tools supporting that portion of the risk assessment
          dealing with public access to federal information systems. </p>
        <p>Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted by organizations at various
          steps in the Risk Management Framework including: information system categorization;
          security control selection; security control implementation; security control assessment;
          information system authorization; and security control monitoring. RA-3 is a noteworthy
          security control in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the
          implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the Risk
          Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in the security control
          selection process during the application of tailoring guidance for security control
          baselines and when considering supplementing the tailored baselines with additional
          security controls or control enhancements.</p>

        <p>The security categorization of the information system guides the frequency and

          scanning includes scanning for specific functions, ports, protocols, and services that

      <stmt name="supplemental-guidance">
        <p>An external information system service is a service that is implemented outside of the
          authorization boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that is
          used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with
          external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through
          joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., contracts,
          interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or
          supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for adequately mitigating risks arising from
          the use of external information system services remains with the authorizing official.
          Authorizing officials require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with
          external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with information
          security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires that the
          organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider
          in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for
          the services rendered to the organization. The extent and nature of this chain of trust
          varies based on the relationship between the organization and the external provider. Where
          a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or service
          providers, the organization employs compensating security controls or accepts the greater
          degree of risk. The external information system services documentation includes
          government, service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any
          service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance
          for each required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies
          and response requirements for any identified instance of noncompliance.</p>

          trustworthiness and making explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing, developing,
          and implementing organizational information systems. Trustworthiness is a characteristic
          or property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be
          expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information
          being processed, stored, or transmitted by the system. Trustworthy information systems are
          systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite
          the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to
          occur in the specified environments of operation. Two factors affecting the
          trustworthiness of an information system include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the
          security features or functions employed within the system); and (ii) security assurance
          (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its
          application). </p>

          management, operational, and technical security controls necessary to mitigate risk to
          organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
          Appropriate security assurance can be obtained by: (i) the actions taken by developers and
          implementers of security controls with regard to the design, development, implementation,
          and operation of those controls; and (ii) the actions taken by assessors to determine the
          extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
          producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
          information system. </p>
        <p>Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security controls by employing
          well-defined security policy models, structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and
          software development techniques, and sound system/security engineering principles.
          Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the initiation,
          acquisition/development, implementation, and operations/maintenance phases of the system
          development life cycle. For example, developmental evidence may include the techniques and
          methods used to design and develop security functionality. Operational evidence may
          include flaw reporting and remediation, the results of security incident reporting, and
          the results of the ongoing monitoring of security controls. Independent assessments by
          qualified assessors may include analyses of the evidence as well as testing, inspections,
          and audits. Minimum assurance requirements are described in Appendix E. </p>
        <p>Explicit trustworthiness decisions highlight situations where achieving the information
          system resilience and security capability necessary to withstand cyber attacks from
          adversaries with certain threat capabilities may require adjusting the risk management
          strategy, the design of mission/business processes with regard to automation, the
          selection and implementation rigor of management and operational protections, or the
          selection of information technology components with higher levels of trustworthiness.
          Trustworthiness may be defined on a component-by-component, subsystem-by-subsystem, or
          function-by-function basis. It is noted, however, that typically functions, subsystems,
          and components are highly interrelated, making separation by trustworthiness perhaps
          problematic and at a minimum, something that likely requires careful attention in order to
          achieve practically useful results. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SC-3.</p>

              device is a virtual private network. When a non-remote connection is established using
              a virtual private network, the configuration settings prevent split-tunneling. Split
              tunneling might otherwise be used by remote users to communicate with the information

          servers are commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated
          (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). With regard to role separation, DNS
          servers with an internal role, only process name/address resolution requests from within
          the organization (i.e., internal clients). DNS servers with an external role only process
          name/address resolution information requests from clients external to the organization
          (i.e., on the external networks including the Internet). The set of clients that can
          access an authoritative DNS server in a particular role is specified by the organization
          (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists).</p>

        <p>The organization identifies information systems containing software affected by recently
          announced software flaws (and potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws) and
          reports this information to designated organizational officials with information security
          responsibilities (e.g., senior information security officers, information system security
          managers, information systems security officers). The organization (including any
          contractor to the organization) promptly installs security-relevant software updates
          (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security
          assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system
          error handling, are also addressed expeditiously. Organizations are encouraged to use
          resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and
          Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational information
          systems. By requiring that flaw remediation be incorporated into the organizational
          configuration management process, it is the intent of this control that
          required/anticipated remediation actions are tracked and verified. An example of expected
          flaw remediation that would be so verified is whether the procedures contained in US-CERT
          guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts have been accomplished. Related
          controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, MA-2, IR-4, RA-5, SA-11, SI-11.</p>

        <p>Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail
          servers, web servers, proxy servers, and remote-access servers. Malicious code includes,
          for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be
          encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode) or contained within a compressed
          file. Removable media includes, for example, USB devices, diskettes, or compact disks. A
          variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious
          code attacks. Pervasive configuration management and strong software integrity controls
          may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
          off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This
          could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that
          could affect organizational missions and business functions. Traditional malicious code
          protection mechanisms are not built to detect such code. In these situations,
          organizations must rely instead on other risk mitigation measures to include, for example,
          secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, configuration management and
          control, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions
          other than those intended. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SI-4, SI-7.</p>

        <p>Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External
          monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part
          of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the
          observation of events occurring within the system (e.g., within internal organizational
          networks and system components). Information system monitoring capability is achieved
          through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion
          prevention systems, malicious code protection software, audit record monitoring software,
          network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for
          example, at selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical
          applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces
          associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The Einstein network monitoring device from the
          Department of Homeland Security is an example of a system monitoring device. The
          granularity of the information collected is determined by the organization based on its
          monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to support such
          activities. An example of a specific type of transaction of interest to the organization
          with regard to monitoring is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses
          organizational HTTP proxies, when use of such proxies is required. Related controls: AC-4,
