        <p>Each IT goal presents an implicit link to an IT goal specified elsewhere in COBITS (the

          identifier (01-17) and a title, and glossed with a brief statement, <q>Metrics</q>. These
          are captured inside the <code>enhancement</code> as <code>prop with
          @class='number'</code>, <code>title</code> and <code>stmt with
          @class='metrics'</code>.</p>
        <p>The fact that this is an IT-related control enhancement is captured by including a

      <stmt class="remarks">
        <p>The control enhancement used to describe this is the same as is used for the next table,
          the process-related goal table. Note however that the IT-related goals (as indicated by
          the <code>scope</code> property) are implicit cross-links to elsewhere in OSCAL.</p>

        <p>Like IT-related goals, each process-related goal has a number, title and <q>Metrics</q>
          section. In this case, however, the property <code>prop with @class='scope'</code> has the

          input is not listed. Only inputs designated for this particular control (practice) are
