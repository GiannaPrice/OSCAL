Issues / questions ISO 27001/2 analysis

x Information capture options (we'll start with EPUB)
  David inquiring re: ISO STS option

x Surrounding materials (intro/front matter etc etc) - out of scope? (yes, for now: DW)

x 'description' will be normative - every control must have this element
x add control/@type
x so 'control' has at least (title, description)
x map ISO stuff in!
x We need some sort of (nested) div structure for document structure
  e.g. clause, family

o 'preamble' section including declarations
   including constraints on properties
     (make these OSCAL controls?)

o merge 'implementation' sections from 800-53A into draft control
