Issues / questions ISO 27001/2 analysis

x Information capture options (we'll start with EPUB)
  David inquiring re: ISO STS option

x Surrounding materials (intro/front matter etc etc) - out of scope? (yes, for now: DW)

x 'description' will be normative - every control must have this element
x add control/@type
x so 'control' has at least (title, description)
x map ISO stuff in!
x We need some sort of (nested) div structure for document structure
  e.g. clause, family

o merge 'implementation' sections from 800-53A (PDF!) into draft control

x rename nested catalog as 'group' (DW)

o xrefs and linking! -
  o xref for internal links?
  o 'a' for external links?

o induction of implicit cross-references from SP800-53?
  e.g. inside supplemental guidance

o pull in more data from PDFs e.g. in 800-53 control enhancements
  Maybe do all of section AC (account controls)
o presentational XSLT (PDF?) for cross-checking / proofing

o "Media Protection" section (passim!)

o Define an ID assignment protocol and add IDs?

o 'preamble' section including declarations
     control-spec (describing the structure of a control)
     param-spec (naming permissible/recognized parameters)
     authority (referencing external authorities / sources)
o implement PDF production pipeline
o implement XSLT 1.0 (client side) runtime resolution/display

o inside runtime:
  o parameter value assignments
  o semantic associations
    (e.g. formal mappings between control properties)
  
inside declarations:
  control-spec { @name, control-label?, parameter-spec*, statement-spec*, authority* )
    o expansion for run-in label?
      (so you can say to promote prop[@name='number'] into the control title for display)
  parameter-spec including lexical contraints
  statement-spec
    o expansions e.g. to provide header "Other considerations" to stmt[@type='other-considerations']"
  o authority (binding to external resource or copy)
  o Schematron for all this stuff!  
  
What sorts of things do we need to validate at the level of a control?
  Properties and statements that (may|must) appear
  Lexical form of properties
    * enumerated list
    * regex
    * numbering semantics (xsl:number?)
    * referential integrity (co-occurrence constraints)
      e.g. if in section "Access Control" then ID must start 'AC' ...

o remove sequence, clause, control-group properties (or anything so redundant)

  Model must enable auto-production of Schematron per profile?

OOO what have we done so far?
     including screen shot
o Run Trang and debug XSD (ugh)

Any different for control enhancements?
o model OSCAL map? for Schematron validation

o rendering XSLT to make a pretty page display (or PDF?)

GOALS for next checkpoint
o Complete and valid mappings for both sources
o CSS for oXygen display
o functioning RNC and Schematron
???

o first cut at XSD?
o embed documentation (and stage documentation pipeline?)
