Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) 

The Cloud First policy established by the U.S. Federal CIO in December 2010, mandates that agencies take full advantage of cloud computing benefits to maximize capacity utilization, improve IT flexibility and responsiveness, and minimize cost. By 2012, a subsequent report to Congress showed that more than half of all federal agencies had adopted cloud computing for at least one application. The rapid adoption of cloud computing under this mandate is not voiding any of the agencies’ FISMA requirements for adequate security and privacy protection of data. 

NIST is proposing the development of the Open Security Controls Assessment Language, or OSCAL, a hierarchical, formatted, XML-based (and JSON translation) schema that provides a standard for encoding different categories of information pertaining to the security controls’ implementation and assessment process.  

OSCAL aims to:
1.	Standardize the description of a control based upon the standard used (NIST SP 800.53, ISO/IEC 27001/2, PCI, SOX, etc), 
2.	standardize the reporting format of a security control implementation for a particular ‘technology’ (cloud computing, cyber physical systems, mobile, etc.) – for an Overlay (see NIST SP 800-53 R4 for more details) -  or for a particular ‘scope’ or 'purpose' for which the control is implemented (e.g. the control is implemented for physical access or logical access to a, b, c layers). 
3.	standardize the format of the documented assessment criteria, 
4.	standardize the format of the metrics and measurements for the continuous monitoring of the control, and 
5.	other custom information standardization.
