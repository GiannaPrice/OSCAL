            <p class="justification">NEED. If there is a significant high-impact risk of inadvertent or intentional data leakage with a system deployed in a shared-service environment, this control is justified to mitigate that risk. Similar justification applies when an organization needs to ensure data isolation between different types of information enclaves within the organization.
ANALYSIS. Although this control is usually employed to control flows between different classified enclaves, it  can also apply to non-classified scenarios (e.g., the need to isolate legal, personnel, health-related, financial, or other information or files deemed sensitive. 
SAMPLE THREAT VECTORS.  Sensitive free-text information passes from the personnel department to the rest of the organization. Law-enforcement sensitive information is inadvertently pulled from the organization's general counsel case management system and passed outside the department to users without authorization to view that information. HIPAA-protected health information flows freely from the HR department to all employees. Privacy-Act information flows from an HR system into a publicly released report.

This is an unanticipated vector for attack if present and active. While probably not an issue with data center servers and networking devices, wireless is becoming embedded in many  components and devices such as printers, fax devices, copiers, scanners, communications devices, etc. There is the additional potential that wireless capabilities may become available in air conditioners, power centers, power controllers, lighting, alarm systems, etc. There is a potential that these capabilities could exist without organizational awareness. Selection drivedsawareness. It's better to perform the check than to make assumptions about what devices are in the IS.

ECSB Supplemental Guidance as the C/CE relates to CSPs
The application of this control enchancement should include all systems and devices in the CSP facility such as printers, fax devices, copiers, scanners, communications devices, air conditioners, power centers, power controllers, lighting, alarm systems,  etc. Wireless networking capabilities should be disabled when they are near or networked with systems supporting customer's services.

            <p class="justification">NEED. Organization requires independent data to validate that current security monitoring continues to target the right data, and that no gaps have opened between what is currently measured and what needs to be measured given the constantly evolving threat environment. In particular, the organization determines that security management will need trend analytics tuned to the current security climate to ensure the organization’s security officials maintain general situational awareness of larger security trends that may pose a threat to the organization’s high-impact systems fielded in shared-service environments.

ANALYSIS. Implementation of this control should provide security management with a technical advantage by forcing them to maintain continual current awareness of the larger security threat-scape, rather than become lost in the lower-level details of specific security metrics. 

SAMPLE THREAT VECTORS ADDRESSED. Stakeholders do not have the information they need to make sound decisions due to technology capability. System fails to send alarms, logs, and other pertinent data to the event manager. Control processes involve too many layers of review, concurrence, and revision to support effective and timely conveyance of relevant information to decision-makers. Monitoring not effectively linked to control processes.

            <p class="justification">Rationale for SA L1: Cryptographic mechanisms are only required at this level for priviledged user (system administrator / SA) access control and the transport of privileged commands or configuration files. Not the publicly released information served at this level. 
Rationale for Selection L2-6: Best practice. Supplemental guidance for this CE refers primarily to the processes surrounding the management of the cryptographic mechanisms used. These processes need to be under change management that addresses security concerns to ensure they remain secure.

CE supplemental guidance.
Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key, private key, shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures in place to effectively manage those means. For example, if devices use certificates as a basis for identification and authentication, there needs to be a process in place to address the expiration of those certificates.

ANALYSIS. Organizations can use COTS tools and techniques to implement this control in many ways. Agencies should be prepared to document their plan and approach to this control technique.

            <p class="justification">Rationale for Selection:  Best practice for authenticated web services and best business practice for the protection of the CSP and customer alike.  ECSB sees this as a significant value add toward the protection of customer accounts on SaaS or customer service / managent interfaces/portals.
L1 Rationale for SA: No authenticators are required for user access to public informationl. Info sensitivity does not warrant. However this CE would be required priviledged user access to manage the system server(s) containing public information.

ECSB Supplemental Guidance as the C/CE relates to CSPs: CSP must minimally implement this control enhancement on all SaaS offerings and customer service / managent interfaces. The time period can be negotiated in the SLA. 
NOTE: while the browser or other client cashes the authenticator, the server must enforce its expiration if the client does not.

            <p class="justification">NEED. Organization requires near real-time subsystem reconfiguration for high-impact systems, especially those deployed wholly or partially into shared-service environments. This dynamic reconfiguration is required for core infrastructure components such as routers, firewalls, messaging gateways, or access control/authentication servers, especially when these core components are under cyber-attack.

ANALYSIS. These critical cyber controls are well understood, and to some extent their automated capability has been established. Other aspects still require human decisions. Since this technology area is rapidly changing to meet new cyber-threat scenarios, it is expected that implementation of this control will be subject to significant change for the foreseeable future.

            <p class="justification">NEED. Due to the direct connection between system function and critical mission/business capability, the system requires Continuity-of-Operations (COOP) controls.

ANALYSIS. These critical cyber controls are well understood, and to some extent their automated capability has been established. Other aspects still require human decisions. Since this technology area is rapidly changing to meet new cyber-threat scenarios and also changes in subsystem technology, it is expected that implementation of this control will be subject to significant change for the foreseeable future. Even so, its technology advantages are fundamental, especially for high-impact systems infrastructure.

SAMPLE THREAT VECTORS. The system does not have error-correcting or self-recovery capabilities. The system is not designed to allow for quick remediation of threats that will impact the system. Time does not allow for the design in error handling, self-recovery, or to capitalize on system diversity to restore a system.  Also, the organization lacks the expertise to develop or implement a plan for restoring system. A malicious change may be implemented to counter the ability to restore the system.

            <p class="justification">NEED. High-impact systems will require special measures to ensure security incidents are correctly and effectively handled in a timely manner. This high-level control supports that need, and is therefore warranted as a baseline for high-impact systems in shared-service environments.
ANALYSIS. Implementation of this general control is well understood among Departments and Agencies. However, it may require special funding and time to implement in a shared service environment, where response roles and responsibilities demand vigilant analysis and definition.
SAMPLE THREAT VECTORS.  Insiders gain access to information for which they have no authorization. Insiders push sensitive information to outside networks not authorized to receive it. Insiders violate agency information-security policies. Insider actions are not monitored.

            <p class="justification">Rationale for Selection:    Best practice business practice for the protection of the CSP and customer alike.  Protects against unauthorized access and compromise of the CSP infrastructure. See Supplemental Guidance

ECSB Supplemental Guidance as the C/CE relates to CSPs:  While AC-17(2) is similar to this CE and implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions, System configuration, maintenance and diagnostic communications can be considered sensitive information and it is in DoD. Maintaining the confidrntiality and integrity of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications helps maintain the health of the system, prevents unauthorized access from sniffing and MITM atacks, etc. While beneficial this selection may not be required for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications over the CSP's private network and particularly if that network is out of band. Encryption is required if such communications are over a network external to the CSP (e.g., the Internet).

            <p class="justification">NEED. Organizations commonly run vulnerability scanning tools against diverse enterprise systems and subsystems. These tools are often attuned to the specific subsystems, and often provided by different manufacturers. Because there is no single-vendor consolidation of all scanning tools, organizations need to correlate the outputs of these tools in order to triangulate on potential threats that may be related, or identical at their source. When the security impact is high a shared-service environment may increase the number of independent scanning tools, implementation of this control is warranted.

ANALYSIS. Although this control is well understood by vendors, its implementation takes many forms, depending on the scanning tools adopted by a particular organization. 

SAMPLE THREAT VECTORS. Different scanning tools discover low-impact vulnerabilities in multiple subsystems of a system. Considered individually, none of them warrants immediate action,; yet when considered together, they constitute a significant attack pattern.

ANALYSIS. Isolation techniques are well understood in the cyber market, and constantly evolving. Example techniques include honey pots and honey nets. Both techniques can isolate a user, an autonomous application, or an entire subsystem.

SAMPLE THREAT VECTORS. Anomalous user behavior is detected Messages arrive from suspect domains. Messages arrive with suspect attachments. Applications begin to behave anomalously. Subsystems begin moving data anomalously.

ECSB Supplemental Guidance as the C/CE relates to CSPs:  This enhancement works in conjunction with or opposite of AC-2 (13) which requires acount disablement within a specific time frame of discovering or identifying an individual posing a significant insider threat. In some instances the best action is not to terminate the individual's account, but rather to monitor their actions. This allows for the ability to collect evidence (for prosecution) and obtain insight into the TTPs that they may be using  and others they may working with. Termination of the account is often best left as a final act.

Supports the mitigation of insider threat from those that can do the most damage. While CSPs typically claim they only have privileged users in their infrastructure (other than customers), this CEadds value for privilege users that have higher privilege than others.

ANALYSIS. The tools and techniques for implementing this monitoring control are no longer unusual, but their implementation still requires careful initial analysis of tools, standards, and sources for indicators of compromise (IOC) data. This capability is not a simple matter of installing COTS software and watching for alerts. Rather, it requires staff to maintain a keen understanding of the threat-scape in order to properly understand the alerts coming from the IOC subsystem.

SAMPLE THREAT VECTORS. Temporary files appear but are not associated with any known system processes; independent security services warn of new surveillance techniques appearing globally; evidence of those new techniques appears in an organization’s event logs. Reports on the payload of a new botnet indicate that the system has been touched by the botnet.
