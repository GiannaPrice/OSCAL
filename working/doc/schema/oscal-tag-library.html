         <h2 class="title">OSCAL: the Open Security Controls Assessment Language</h2>
  
  
         <h2 class="title">OSCAL namespace</h2>
         <p class="p">The element population of an OSCAL document (set) may be determined by means of XPath
        distinct-values(//*/node-name()), or analogous query.</p>
         <p class="p">Conformant (valid) OSCAL documents will not contain elements not described in this
      specification. While OSCAL may be mixed with other tag sets, or extended, neither of these
      uses is described or circumscribed by this document, which provides only bare-bones
      information about the OSCAL <q class="q">core</q>.</p>
         <p class="p">For its XML names, OSCAL uses the namespace <a class="xref">XXX http://scap.nist.gov/schema/oscal XXX</a>.
      Commonly, this will be assigned to (unprefixed) names in an OSCAL document by default, and in
      this document, OSCAL elements (and attributes, presumed to be in no-namespace) are referenced
      without a prefix, oscal: or any other.</p>
         <p class="p">By design, OSCAL looks a lot like HTML on the inside. Transformations to HTML, however, should
      always strip the OSCAL namespace, to produce HTML in the appropriate namespace for the target
      application. (Or the target application could learn to consume OSCAL.) Only some parts of
      HTML, however, make their way into OSCAL, which is designed to address its own
      requirements.</p>
  
  
         <h2 class="title">OSCAL organization</h2>
         <p class="p">OSCAL catalogs are built out of controls. Essentially, OSCAL is a lightweight and free-form
        <q class="q">documentary</q> format, which includes semantic <q class="q">islands</q> of structured information.
      These are <q class="q">semantic</q> not only because they are addressable in principle, but more
      importantly because their organizations and values may be known (at least with respect to
      certain operations and relations), before processing occurs, even (at the most general level)
      before operations are designed and deployed. OSCAL offers a Yin to the Yang of query and
      processing.</p>
         <p class="p">At the broadest level, <q class="q">control objects</q> in OSCAL, as it is formally defined, include
      controls, subcontrols (i.e. control extensions), parts of controls or subcontrols, and control
      groups. In other words, <q class="q">control</q> over OSCAL data structures is offered at many levels at
      once. It will be the job of a particular OSCAL application domain to determine what the most
      appopriate level of description, for that domain, to describe best as <q class="q">control</q>,
        <q class="q">subcontrol</q> etc.</p>
         <p class="p">This organization is governed by an XML schema, which enforces containment constraints among
      these elements. In particular, the OSCAL schema declares elements for <code class="code control">
               <a href="#tag_control">control</a>
            </code>,
        <code class="code subcontrol">
               <a href="#tag_subcontrol">subcontrol</a>
            </code> and <code class="code part">
               <a href="#tag_part">part</a>
            </code>. According to its rules, subcontrols may only
      appear within controls. Either controls or subcontrols may be partitioned (may contain parts),
      and parts may contain their own parts. Any of these objects may be <q class="q">controlled</q> in the
      sense that they may be used, consistently, to carry regular sets of properties, whose names
      and value spaces may be known in advance, or discovered dynamically.</p>
  
  
         <h2 class="title">Interoperability with other data formats</h2>
         <p class="p">OSCAL should map easily and straightforwardly to any generic XML or tag-based markup language
      including HTML, Markdown and its variants, NISO JATS, DITA, etc. etc. Additionally, OSCAL
      documents may be taken as <q class="q">warrants for inference</q> for serialization of linked data
      objects or other application binding formats including JSON.</p>
         <p class="p">Because OSCAL is semantically richer and denser than most markup languages as used, however,
      automated conversion into OSCAL from any of these formats is likely to require tuning or
      customization per instance - that is, each one will be a one-off conversion.</p>
  
         <section class="group">
            <h2 class="title">Controls and control components</h2>
            <p class="p">The foundations of OSCAL are in control objects, such as controls and subcontrols, and their
      components, including both controlled components, and relatively uncontrolled or free-form
      contents. The latter category of information is described elsewhere as <a class="xref" href="#">Prose</a>. The former category is described here.</p>

      mechanism, without requiring modification of any schemas, using a simple, native set of
      declarations for controls.</p>
         <p class="p">OSCAL's validation model consists of several layers. At base is schema validation, which
      ensures that all tags in use are recognized as OSCAL tagging and that their arrangement in the
      document (with regard to both structure, and certain <q class="q">semantic</q> relations) is consistent
      with regular usage of OSCAL. In a second layer, other relationships can be tested and rules
      enforced, over and above what a schema imposes. Implemented in Schematron or any technology
      with analogous capabilities, such as second layer is more flexible and configurable than the
      base layer.</p>
         <p class="p">In a third layer, an OSCAL document is validated to constraints it declares for itself, that
      is locally in its own declarations. (Call this a <q class="q">consistency check</q> rather than
      validation, for clarity.) Such a validation may be useful to an OSCAL implementation, which
      can take advantage of contracts implicit in such validation to provide functionalities; OSCAL
      itself does not provide such functionality, but only the hooks – and the mechanism by which
      users and developers can easily create and manage new control types.</p>
