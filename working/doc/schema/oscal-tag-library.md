# OSCAL: The Open Security Controls Assessment Language  

## OSCAL namespace 

Conformant (valid) OSCAL documents will not contain elements not described in this document. While OSCAL may be mixed with other tag sets or extended, neither of these uses is described here: this document provides only basic information about the OSCAL "core". 

The element population of an OSCAL document (set) may be determined by means of XPath `distinct-values(//*/node-name())`, or analogous query. 

For its XML names, OSCAL uses the namespace XXX http://scap.nist.gov/schema/oscal XXX. Commonly, this will be assigned to (unprefixed) names in an OSCAL document by default, and in this document, OSCAL elements (and attributes, presumed to be in no-namespace) are referenced without a prefix, `oscal:` or any other. 

By design, OSCAL looks a lot like HTML on the inside. Transformations to HTML, however, should always strip the OSCAL namespace to produce HTML in the appropriate namespace for the target application. (Or the target application could learn to consume OSCAL.) Only some parts of HTML, however, make their way into OSCAL, which is designed to address its own requirements.   

## OSCAL organization 

OSCAL catalogs are built out of controls. Essentially, OSCAL is a lightweight and free-form "documentary" format, which includes semantic "islands" of structured information. These are semantic not only because they are addressable in principle, but more importantly because their organizations and values may be known before processing occurs, at least with respect to certain operations and relations, and even (at the most general level) before operations are designed and deployed. OSCAL offers a yin to the yang of query and processing. 

At the broadest level, "control objects" in OSCAL include controls, subcontrols, parts of controls or subcontrols, and control groups. Each OSCAL application or application domain will determine for itself how these correspond to entities or "controls", formal processes, procedures and so forth, within that domain. 

This organization is governed by an XML schema, which enforces containment constraints among these elements. In particular, the OSCAL schema declares elements for group, control, subcontrol and part. According to its rules, either controls or groups may appear within groups (that is, groups may be nested or may contain controls), while subcontrols may only appear within controls. Either controls or subcontrols may be partitioned (may contain parts), and parts may contain their own parts. While this design centers around controls and subcontrols, by means of the use of groups and parts, OSCAL can support organizations of controls and their components with arbitrary granularity -- as any of these objects may be used consistently to carry regular sets of properties, with names and value spaces that may be known in advance or discovered dynamically.   

## Interoperability with other data formats 

OSCAL should map easily and straightforwardly to any generic XML or tag-based markup language including HTML, Markdown and its variants, NISO JATS, DITA, etc. Additionally, OSCAL documents may be taken as "warrants for inference" for serialization of linked data objects or other application binding formats including JSON. 

Because OSCAL is designed to carry richer and denser semantics than most markup languages as used, however, automated conversion into OSCAL from any of these formats (or at any rate, into a process-oriented and optimized OSCAL) is likely to require tuning or customization per instance - that is, each one will be a one-off conversion.   

## Controls and control components 

The foundations of OSCAL are in control objects, such as controls and subcontrols, and their components, including both formal components (described here) and relatively uncontrolled or free-form contents (described elsewhere as [prose](#prose)). 

### &lt;catalog> Catalog   

Top-level element for a (canonical) control catalog   

### &lt;collection> Collection   

Top-level element for a set of controls, not considered to be a catalog  

##### remarks 

Most often, a collection element will be used for a set of controls derived from one or more control catalogs (such as a profile, baseline, or overlay), which do not themselves serve as a catalog. However, collections may contain everything that catalogs may contain, and OSCAL does not prohibit their use as (source or interim) catalogs for profiling, although an individual application might.   

### &lt;control> Control   

A structured information object representing a security control  

##### remarks 

Controls may be grouped using group, and controls may be partitioned using either (formally) subcontrol or (informally) part.   

### &lt;subcontrol> Control extension   

An associated control within a control  

##### remarks 

A nominal subcontrol or "control extension" permits catalogs to offer access to structured control objects within controls. Further levels down can be achieved using part (both controls and subcontrols may be partitioned), which may contain their own parts; however, knowing in advance which "controls" and "subcontrols" are especially significant is helpful.   

### &lt;prop> Property   

A value with a name, attributed to the containing control, subcontrol, part, or group  

##### remarks 

The notation used by a property is up to an application; otherwise, properties are distinguished in OSCAL by not permitting inline markup of any kind. They are expected to be simple scalar values or to use machine-readable/parseable notation (not XML), as defined by and for an application. 

The lexical composition of properties may be constrained by declarations including matching to regular expressions or declaring known datatype notations (tbd). 

Because properties are often used as selectors or identifiers for OSCAL operations, their values can be expected frequently to be flattened (markup stripped) and normalized (e.g., with respect to whitespace) in use; however this is application defined. 

For singletons (that is, the only element among siblings with its `@class`), properties are especially useful as proxies (unique identifiers) for their controls, such that controls may be returned one for one on queries for properties (name and value). The robustness of such queries can be ensured by appropriate property declarations (as singletons and as identifiers); cf `property` in the declarations model (which also supports other constraints over property values). 

Properties permit the deployment and management of arbitrary controlled values, with and among control objects (controls and parts and extensions), for any purpose useful to an application or implementation of those controls. Typically and routinely, properties will be used to sort, select, order, and arrange controls or relate them to one another or to class hierarchies, taxonomies, or external authorities.   

### &lt;param> Parameter   

A parameter setting, to be propagated to points of insertion   

### &lt;part> Part   

A component or partition in a control, subcontrol, or part  

##### remarks 

Like properties (prop) and parameters (param), parts can be distinguished from other elements within their controls by their assigned `@class`, such that they may be subjected to "declarations logic" using these values as bindings (and thereby getting open-ended extensibility). 

An assigned class may frequently provide for a header in display, such that `part[@class='objectives']` is displayed under a header *Objectives*, etc. Unlike groups, controls, or subcontrols, however, they may not have title element children (they are not "first class objects" in this sense). Thus, in OSCAL if the components of your controls have their own titles, they are something else; to accommodate data like this, consider using a property (e.g., `prop[@class='part-title']` as an escape hatch.   

### &lt;link> Link   

A line or paragraph with a hypertext link  

##### remarks 

Works like an HTML anchor (a) except this is a line-oriented (block) element.     

## Functional elements 

Functional elements appear inside control content to provide "hooks" to OSCAL processors for retrievability, manipulation (including mapping and transformation), and semantic traversal. 

### &lt;insert> Parameter insertion   

A "call" (reference) to a parameter for dynamic content transclusion   

### &lt;withdrawn> Withdrawn   

Indicates that a containing control or subcontrol is no longer applicable  

##### remarks 

Used to mark a control or subcontrol included in a catalog as a placeholder, to maintain its semantic integrity even in obsolescence. Links should be provided to superseding controls or components. 

The functionality provided by this element might better be offered by a property or some other controlled value, at which point it may be removed; it is included to support (some) legacy content.     

## Declarations elements 

By declaring constraints on control components, such as properties (prop), parts (part) and links (link) within controls and subcontrols, applications and operators can validate the regularity and composition of available controls. By documenting constraints that are enforceable at need, declarations also serve as an implicit "semantic contract" between a control catalog (or set of controls valid to a set of OSCAL declarations). 

In this way, the OSCAL declarations mechanism provides for a kind of "on the fly supertyping" of control objects, by restriction (constraint) of the core OSCAL language. The extent and degree to which declarations are used to impose order on controls is up to the application and its methods. By no means are declarations necessary; rather, they serve as an aid in modeling and in communicating expectations. 

OSCAL declarations are enforced by a Schematron; the core schema stipulates their model but does not enforce any of the constraints so declared. Developers should take note that these constraints are all readily testable in XPath. 

### &lt;declarations> Declarations   

For extra-schema validation of control components within controls  

##### remarks 

The OSCAL validation model supports not only validation against a formal schema (describing elements, attributes, and their permitted contents, described generally and generically), but also against a set of declarations provided specifically for the catalog or catalog type within which they appear. Constraints described in these declarations, and bound via assignments of `@class` (for control components) and `@context` (indicating control, subcontrol or part wherein the components may appear), enable automated checking for consistency of controls, subcontrols and their parts, specific to the types or kinds of control items that appear within a particular catalog or control collection.   

### &lt;declare-property> Property declaration   

Constraints applicable to a class or classes of p elements within a control object   

### &lt;declare-p> Paragraph declaration   

Indicates constraints to be enforced on paragraphs in context   

### &lt;declare-part> Part declaration   

Indicates constraints to be imposed on parts in context   

### &lt;declare-link> Link declaration   

Indicates constraints to be imposed on links in context   

### &lt;singleton> Singleton constraint   

The declared component may occur only once in its context  

##### remarks 

When this element is present in the declaration of an OSCAL control component, the component (prop, param, part) must be the only component of that class given in its (group, control, subcontrol, or part) context. In other words, no other element child of the same parent may have the same `@class` value (at the level of syntax) or be bound to the same component type (at the semantic level).   

### &lt;required> Requirement constraint   

The declared component is required in its context  

##### remarks 

When this element is present in the declaration of an OSCAL control component, the component (prop, param, `stmt`, or `feat`) is required to appear, at least once, in its context.   

### &lt;identifier> Identifier constraint   

The declared component has a value unique within the document, among components of the same type  

##### remarks 

This constraint is generally only used for properties to be used as identifiers for their control object (control, subcontrol, or part). Guaranteeing their uniqueness means that these values can be used to effect one-to-one retrieval or reference to the objects to which they are assigned.   

### &lt;regex> Regular expression constraint   

Indicates that the value of a property (prop) or parameter (param) must match the given regular expression  

##### remarks 

Matching against a regular expression is conducted on the normalized lexical value of the given parameter or property: that is, with leading and trailing whitespace stripped, interim whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line feeds) normalized to single spaces, and inline markup stripped.   

### &lt;value> Value constraint   

Indicates a permissible value for a parameter or property  

##### remarks 

In a declaration, value will commonly be given in groups, indicating a set of enumerated permissible values (i.e., for an element to be valid to a value constraint, it must equal one of the given values). 

In a parameter, a value represents a value assignment to the parameter, overriding any value given at the point of insertion. When parameters are provided in OSCAL profiles, their values will override any values assigned "lower down the stack".   

### &lt;autonum> Autonumbered (generated) value   

Generates a formatted numeric value based on the position of a control object among its siblings, the text contents providing a template for the numbering format (arabic, alphabetic, roman, etc)  

##### remarks 

The text contents of autonum (not the value of any attribute), will be taken by the processor to be a formatting code. The format should follow the spec for XSLT `xsl:number/@format`. For example, if the value is "A.", then numbering will appear in the sequence A., B., C., etc (as punctuated). Recognized formats include upper- and lower-case alphabetic numbering, arabic numbering, and upper- and lower-case roman numbering as described for XSLT.   

### &lt;inherit> Inherited value   

Indicates that a value or text within a value should be inherited from a property on a containing control object  

##### remarks 

inherit is typically used to enforce hierarchical numbering within control objects. When given in a value in a declaration, inherit indicates that the value of a property, or a segment of its value, must be the same as a property (prop) higher in the containment hierarchy of a control object. That is, if a property with `@class='number'` is constrained with `value/inherit`, it must be the same as is assigned on the closest ancestor (part, subcontrol, control, or group) with the given property. 

Usually, inherit is used in conjunction with autonum. Using the two elements in combination, for example, the number (property) assigned to a subcontrol appearing inside a control numbered "A1" may be constrained to be "A1-a", "A1-b", etc., depending on the position of the subcontrol within the control. 

If a value must inherit from a property of a different class from the containing control object, `inherit/@from` can be used to indicate the applicable property (by its class). By default, inherit indicates a property value should match an ancestor's property with the same `@class` (the most usual case).   

### &lt;desc> Parameter description   

Indicates and explains the purpose and use of a parameter     

## Structural elements 

### &lt;section> Section   

For partitioning a catalog, collection or section therein  

##### remarks 

Echoes HTML5 section. May contain controls (control) or groups of controls (group).   

### &lt;group> Group   

Related controls or groups (of controls or groups)  

##### remarks 

In addition to controls or groups, groups may be titled and may have their own properties, statements, parameter settings and references, subject to declaration. In this respect they are like controls, subcontrols or parts, but their properties apply to the entire group and must be acquired in processing via inheritance. 

Unlike sections (section elements), groups may not contain arbitrary prose (paragraphs and lists). They may, however, contain statements (stmt), which may be untyped (no `@class`) and therefore unconstrained by declarations.   

### &lt;title> Title   

A fallback for display and navigation, exclusive of more specific properties   

### &lt;references> References   

A group of reference descriptions   

### &lt;ref> Reference   

A reference, with one or more citations to standards, related documents or other resources   

### &lt;std> Standard   

Citation of a formal published standard  

##### remarks 

Echoes the NISO JATS (and NISO STS) std element   

### &lt;citation> Citation   

Citation of a resource  

##### remarks 

Echoes the NISO JATS (and NISO STS) `mixed-citation` element. 

For references to standards, std (qv) may be preferred.     

## Prose 

Prose may ordinarily appear anywhere in a control, subcontrol, or part, or at a higher level. Prose elements echo HTML semantics, although they provide only a deliberately and specifically narrow subset of HTML element types. 

Prose elements may be constrained by declarations like other control components, although this may not often be as useful as imposing constraints over properties and parts. Frequently, a part organization will be used to assign prose to specific known "sections" or "components" of a control (modeled as part or subcontrol). 

### &lt;p> Paragraph   

Paragraph or paragraph fragment  

##### remarks 

This element echoes HTML p; as in HTML, it is not limited to indicating complete or discrete (compositional or logical) paragraphs, but can be used for any text set off on its own line.   

### &lt;pre> Preformatted text   

Retains whitespace in display  

##### remarks 

Echoes HTML pre.   

### &lt;ol> Ordered List   

Appears with numbering in ordinal position  

##### remarks 

Although this echoes HTML ol, renditional aspects of this element are not offered by OSCAL. How lists are to be numbered is left to implementations; it is likely that specific control catalogs will have their own schemes. 

At present there is no support for "continued lists", as we have not seen any in documents in scope for analysis.   

### &lt;ul> Unordered list   

A series of items kept in order but without indicators of sequence; likely bulleted  

##### remarks 

As in HTML, "unordered" does not indicate that the order of contained list items is not respected, only that they are not displayed with any notation indicating their order: that is, bullets, not numbers. 

Note that when sequences or lists appear, it may be as common in OSCAL to list (and control) them as sequences of properties or paragraphs, perhaps grouped in parts or subcontrols. This is very much a display element, convenient when what we have is really prose, not highly organized or "semantic".   

### &lt;li> List item   

An item demarcated with a bullet or numerator   

### &lt;em> Emphasis   

Rhetorical emphasis as typically indicated by a font shift  

##### remarks 

In display, this element can be expected to "toggle", i.e. provide for italics when appearing within roman text, but roman when appearing within italic text. 

Particular semantics (indicating types of emphasis for finer resolution in display or retrieval) may be provided via `@class`.   

### &lt;i> Italics   

Typographical shift to italics  

##### remarks 

An implementation may toggle, i.e., display contents using a roman face when the surrounding text is already italic.   

### &lt;b> Bold   

Typographical shift to bold  

##### remarks 

In display, when the surrounding text is already bold, an implementation may indicate "bold" by means of double-bold or some other typographical distinction.   

### &lt;a> Anchor   

An HTML-style anchor (inline linking element)  

##### remarks 

As in HTML, the link target is indicated by `@href`, with a '#' prefix for an internal cross-reference matching an `@id` elsewhere in the document. 

Anchors without `@href` are not invalid to the OSCAL schema (base validation), but may be reported by a Schematron. An application may promote the contents of an a element, when a valid URI, to serve as the link target if `@href` is missing or not a URI.   

### &lt;q> Quoted text   

An inline segment to appear within quotation marks  

##### remarks 

For practical purposes, this is a cosmetic element with no special semantics other than to provide quotation marks in display.   

### &lt;code> Code   

Inline code  

##### remarks 

Strictly, this element should identify formal code or code fragments.   

### &lt;sup> Superscript   

Superscripted text   

### &lt;sub> Subscript   

Subscripted text   

### &lt;span> Span   

Generic inline container  

##### remarks 

As in HTML, an escape hatch for arbitrary (inline) semantic (or other) tagging.     

## Structural constraints 

####  

Over and above what can be validated with a grammar (in Level 0), there is a small set of constraints governing usage. Validations enforcing them can be implemented via Schematron or another process capable of static analysis of the data.  

### Order of items inside controls  

Within a control, properties, parts, and parameters may occur in any order. 

This specification does not govern how or whether an implementation may respect the order of properties and statements given within a control type. Among properties, formal parts, and parameters within a control, cardinality constraints (where enforced) can help ensure a canonical order. An order may be imposed locally by an application (for example, using a schema that requires all properties to appear before all parts), but this is for its convenience, not because an order is mandated.
