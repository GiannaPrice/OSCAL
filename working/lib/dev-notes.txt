to do list:
  SP800-53 element analysis

criterion
rule
regime/regimen (rule+)
test
control
assertion

Heads-up comparison btw SP800 and OSCAL v0?


OSCAL v0 catalog mechanism?
SP800 catalog mechanism?

What is the need we are going to address?
  What about SP800-53 is good
  (What about other standards are good?)
  Where is the gap
  
How do we approach modeling?
  From scratch?
  SP800-53 schemas?
  Or current (draft) OSCAL models?

Schema development
Data sampling / mockups/conversion/prototyping/testing
Component / UI / application development
