               <p class="p">OSCAL catalogs are comprised of control objects, typically arranged in groups. The
                            top-level control object is <code class="code">control</code>. Other control objects are subcontrols
                              (<code class="code">subcontrol</code>) and features (<code class="code">feat</code>). Subcontrols may only appear
                            (directly) within controls. Features may appear within controls or subcontrols, or may be
                            nested (to any depth) within features.

               <p class="p">Control objects in OSCAL may be characterized as consistent data structures, whose
                            contents are appropriate to their type and application. The type of a control object is
                            labelled by means of its <code class="code">@class</code>. Control objects may validated for
                            consistency between and among objects of the same type, by means of constraining values
                            assigned to the control components (qv) appearing within them.

               </p>
                       
               <p class="p">Note that features (feat) are both control components (only appearing inside control
                            objects) and themselves control objects (which may contain their own properties,
                            statements, and features). As such they are <q class="q">transitional</q> objects. Indeed they may
                            be used for control components below the level of subcontrols. Typically, however, they
                            will be more fragmentary, not providing useful information outside the context of the
                            containing control object.

                            the OSCAL declarations model. This enables catalogs and catalog types to enforce
                            consistency of components across controls of identified and labeled types.

               <p class="p"><code class="code">inherit</code> is typically used to enforce hierarchical numbering within control
                            objects. When given in a <code class="code">value</code> in a declaration, <code class="code">inherit</code>
                            indicates that the value of a property, or a segment of its value, must be the same as a
                            property (<code class="code">prop</code>) higher in the containment hierarchy of a control object. That
                            is, if a property with <code class="code">@class='number'</code> is constrained with
                              <code class="code">value/inherit</code>, it must be the same as is assigned on the closest ancestor
                            (feature, subcontrol, control or group) with the given property.
               </p>
                       
               <p class="p">Usually, <code class="code">inherit</code> is used in conjunction with <code class="code">autonum</code> (qv).
                            Using the two elements in combination, for example, the number (property) assigned to a
                            subcontrol appearing inside a control numbered <q class="q">A1</q> may be constrained to be
                              <q class="q">A1-a</q>, <q class="q">A1-b</q> etc., depending on the position of the subcontrol within the
                            control.

               <p class="p">If a value must inherit from a property of a different class from the containing control
                            object, <code class="code">inherit/@from</code> can be used to indicate the applicable property (by its
                            class). By default, <code class="code">inherit</code> indicates a property value should match an
                            ancestor's property with the same <code class="code">@class</code> (the most usual case).

            <p class="p">Over and above what is validable with a grammar (in Level 0), there is a small set of
                       constraints governing usage. Validations enforcing them can be implemented via Schematron or
                       another process capable of static analysis of the data.

               <p class="p">This specification does not govern how or whether an implementation may respect the order
                            of properties and statements given within a control type. Among properties, statements and
                            parameters (that is, named things) within a control, cardinality constraints (where
                            enforced) can help ensure a canonical order. An order may be imposed locally (for example,
                            by a schema that requires all properties to appear before all statements), but this is for
                            its convenience not because an order is mandated.

         <h2 class="title">Customization layers</h2>
             
         <p class="p">Like many tag languages and machine-readable syntaxes, OSCAL is intended to be extended and
                  customized. Unlike most other formats, however, OSCAL's extension mechanism includes a set of
                  features, supported natively in the language, for extension by the simplest possible
                  mechanism, without requiring modification of any schemas, using a simple, native set of
                  declarations for controls.
         </p>
             
         <p class="p">OSCAL's validation model consists of several layers. At base is schema validation, which
                  ensures that all tags in use are recognized as OSCAL tagging and that their arrangement in the
                  document (with regard to both structure, and certain <q class="q">semantic</q> relations) is consistent
                  with regular usage of OSCAL. In a second layer, other relationships can be tested and rules
                  enforced, over and above what a schema imposes. Implemented in Schematron or any technology
                  with analogous capabilities, such as second layer is more flexible and configurable than the
                  base layer.
         </p>
             
         <p class="p">In a third layer, an OSCAL document is validated to constraints it declares for itself, that
                  is locally in its own declarations. (Call this a <q class="q">consistency check</q> rather than
                  validation, for clarity.) Such a validation may be useful to an OSCAL implementation, which
                  can take advantage of contracts implicit in such validation to provide functionalities; OSCAL
                  itself does not provide such functionality, but only the hooks &#8211; and the mechanism by which
                  users and developers can easily create and manage new control types.
