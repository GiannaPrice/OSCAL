# OSCAL Schema and Instance Document Workspace

This part of the repository contains artifacts that comprise the implementation of the OSCAL catalog and profile layers.

The 'working' subdirectory contains the following:

 * '[lib](lib)' - schemas along with Schematron, CSS, and XSLT files
 * '[doc](doc)' - documentation including mapping documentation plus supporting code; any tag set docs will also be here
 * '[COBIT5](COBIT5)' - OSCAL demo files for COBIT 5 (e.g., XML files for representing COBIT 5 excerpts in OSCAL format for demonstration purposes)
 * '[ISO27002](ISO27002)' - OSCAL demo files for ISO 27002
 * '[SP800-53](SP800-53)' - OSCAL demo files for NIST SP 800-53 (rev 4)
 * '[FedRAMP](FedRAMP) - prototype heading towards representing FedRAMP spreadsheet as a profile (customization) of a baseline derived from SP800-53: currently, we have a profile calling SP800-53; working towards a profile calling an SP800-53 baseline (profile)
 * '[CSF](CSF)' - represented as an OSCAL framework (valid to our schema). Working from a YAML representation of a Cybersecurity Framework document (cf Issue #5)
 
Validations and "prettified" (formal) editing are configured for oXygen XML Editor, and sample documents are provided with the necessary glue code. However, software components invoked by these bindings, including XSLTs and CSSs, are standards-based, and everything done here with oXygen could be done on a different platform. Likewise, demonstrations we have produced thus far only *scratched the surface* of what is possible with OSCAL.

See [docs/prose/Schema-Decisions.md](docs/prose/Schema-Decisions.md) for insights into decisions of interest made for XML schema design and validation.
