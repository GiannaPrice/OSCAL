				<p class="Foreword-Text">ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span> JTC&nbsp;1.</p>
				<p class="Foreword-Text">International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span> Directives, Part 2.</p>
				<p class="Foreword-Text"><span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27002 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;JTC&nbsp;1, <span class="Italic">Information technology</span>, Subcommittee SC 27, <span class="Italic">IT Security techniques</span>.</p>

				<h1 id="toc_marker-2" class="Introduction"><span class="Bold">0	Introduction</span></h1>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Bold">0.1</span>	<span class="Bold">Background and context</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">This International Standard is designed for organizations to use as a reference for selecting controls within the process of implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) based on <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27001<span class="Superscript">[</span><a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-bibr-ref_10-34404"><span class="Superscript">10</span></a><span class="Superscript">]</span> or as a guidance document for organizations implementing commonly accepted information security controls. This standard is also intended for use in developing industry- and organization-specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific information security risk environment(s).</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit) collect, process, store and transmit information in many forms including electronic, physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">The value of information goes beyond the written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information and related processes, systems, networks and personnel involved in their operation, handling and protection are assets that, like other important business assets, are valuable to an organization’s business and consequently deserve or require protection against various hazards.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Assets are subject to both deliberate and accidental threats while the related processes, systems, networks and people have inherent vulnerabilities. Changes to business processes and systems or other external changes (such as new laws and regulations) may create new information security risks. Therefore, given the multitude of ways in which threats could take advantage of vulnerabilities to harm the organization, information security risks are always present. Effective information security reduces these risks by protecting the organization against threats and vulnerabilities, and then reduces impacts to its assets.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. These controls need to be established, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved, where necessary, to ensure that the specific security and business objectives of the organization are met. An ISMS such as that specified in <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27001<span class="Superscript">[</span><a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-bibr-ref_10-34404"><span class="Superscript">10</span></a><span class="Superscript">]</span> takes a holistic, coordinated view of the organization’s information security risks in order to implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls under the overall framework of a coherent management system.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Many information systems have not been designed to be secure in the sense of <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27001<span class="Superscript">[</span><a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-bibr-ref_10-34404"><span class="Superscript">10</span></a><span class="Superscript">]</span> and this standard. The security that can be achieved through technical means is limited and should be supported by appropriate management and procedures. Identifying which controls should be in place requires careful planning and attention to detail. A successful ISMS requires support by all employees in the organization. It can also require participation from shareholders, suppliers or other external parties. Specialist advice from external parties can also be needed.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">In a more general sense, effective information security also assures management and other stakeholders that the organization’s assets are reasonably safe and protected against harm, thereby acting as a business enabler.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Bold">0.2</span>	<span class="Bold">Information security requirements</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">It is essential that an organization identifies its security requirements. There are three main sources of security requirements:</p>
				<p class="List-Number">a)<span class="List-Number-Spacing">	</span>the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organization’s overall business strategy and objectives. Through a risk assessment, threats to assets are identified, vulnerability to and likelihood of occurrence is evaluated and potential impact is estimated;</p>
				<p class="List-Number">b)<span class="List-Number-Spacing">	</span>the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization, its trading partners, contractors and service providers have to satisfy, and their socio-cultural environment;</p>
				<p class="List-Number">c)<span class="List-Number-Spacing">	</span>the set of principles, objectives and business requirements for information handling, processing, storing, communicating and archiving that an organization has developed to support its operations.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Resources employed in implementing controls need to be balanced against the business harm likely to result from security issues in the absence of those controls. The results of a risk assessment will help guide and determine the appropriate management action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing controls selected to protect against these risks.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27005<span class="Superscript">[</span><a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-bibr-ref_11-34404"><span class="Superscript">11</span></a><span class="Superscript">]</span> provides information security risk management guidance, including advice on risk assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance, risk communication, risk monitoring and risk review.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Bold">0.3</span>	<span class="Bold">Selecting controls</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Controls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new controls can be designed to meet specific needs as appropriate.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">The selection of controls is dependent upon organizational decisions based on the criteria for risk acceptance, risk treatment options and the general risk management approach applied to the organization, and should also be subject to all relevant national and international legislation and regulations. Control selection also depends on the manner in which controls interact to provide defence in depth.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Some of the controls in this standard can be considered as guiding principles for information security management and applicable for most organizations. The controls are explained in more detail below along with implementation guidance. More information about selecting controls and other risk treatment options can be found in <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27005.<span class="Superscript">[</span><a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-bibr-ref_11-34404"><span class="Superscript">11</span></a><span class="Superscript">]</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Bold">0.4</span>	<span class="Bold">Developing your own guidelines</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">This International Standard may be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines. Not all of the controls and guidance in this code of practice may be applicable. Furthermore, additional controls and guidelines not included in this standard may be required. When documents are developed containing additional guidelines or controls, it may be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this standard where applicable to facilitate compliance checking by auditors and business partners.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Bold">0.5</span>	<span class="Bold">Lifecycle considerations</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Information has a natural lifecycle, from creation and origination through storage, processing, use and transmission to its eventual destruction or decay. The value of, and risks to, assets may vary during their lifetime (e.g.&nbsp;unauthorized disclosure or theft of a company’s financial accounts is far less significant after they have been formally published) but information security remains important to some extent at all stages.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Information systems have lifecycles within which they are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and eventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be taken into account at every stage. New system developments and changes to existing systems present opportunities for organizations to update and improve security controls, taking actual incidents and current and projected information security risks into account.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Bold">0.6</span>	<span class="Bold">Related standards</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">While this standard offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are commonly applied in many different organizations, the remaining standards in the <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27000 family provide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing information security.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Refer to <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27000 for a general introduction to both ISMSs and the family of standards. <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27000 provides a glossary, formally defining most of the terms used throughout the <span class="No-Break">ISO/IEC</span>&nbsp;27000 family of standards, and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family.</p>

				<p class="Body-Text">In addition to securely managing secret and private keys, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered. This authentication process can be done using public key certificates, which are normally issued by a certification authority, which should be a recognized organization with suitable controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services, e.g. with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services (see <a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-sec-sec_15.2-34404">15.2</a>).</p>

				<p class="Body-Text">Groups of information services, users and information systems should be segregated on networks.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Underline">Implementation guidance</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">One method of managing the security of large networks is to divide them into separate network domains. The domains can be chosen based on trust levels (e.g. public access domain, desktop domain, server domain), along organizational units (e.g. human resources, finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational units). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different logical networks (e.g.virtual private networking).</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">The perimeter of each domain should be well defined. Access between network domains is allowed, but should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria for segregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based on an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance with the access control policy (see <a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-sec-sec_9.1.1-34404">9.1.1</a>), access requirements, value and classification of information processed and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway technology.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly defined network perimeter. For sensitive environments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network controls policy (see <a href="#TPSXRefTextDestination-6-sec-sec_13.1.1-34404">13.1.1</a>) before granting access to internal systems.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text">The authentication, encryption and user level network access control technologies of modern, standards based wireless networks may be sufficient for direct connection to the organization’s internal network when properly implemented.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Underline">Other information</span></p>
				<p class="Body-Text">Networks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such extensions can increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization’s information systems that use the network, some of which require protection from other network users because of their sensitivity or criticality.</p>
