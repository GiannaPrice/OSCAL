    <!-- FedRAMP inputs from template -->
    
    <!-- 
    The FedRAMP template captures information security control as it is implemented on the system. 
    All controls originate from a system or from a business process.  
    It is important to describe where the control originates from so that it is clear whose responsibility it is to implement, 
    manage and monitor the control.  In some cases, the responsibility is shared by a CSP and by the customer.  
    Use the definitions in the table that follows to indicate where each security control originates from.  
    
    For SaaS and PaaS systems that are inheriting controls from an IaaS (or anything lower in the stack), 
    the “inherited” check box must be checked and the implementation description must simply say “inherited.”  
    FedRAMP reviewers will determine whether the control-set is appropriate or not.
	In Section 13, the NIST term "organization defined" must be interpreted as being the CSP's responsibility unless otherwise indicated.
