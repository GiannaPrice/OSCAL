                           <p class="p">Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges
                    and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.
                    Separation of duties includes, for example, dividing mission functions and
                    system support functions among different individuals and/or roles; conducting
                    system support functions with different individuals; and ensuring security
                    personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit
                    functions. Because separation of duty violations can span systems and
                    application domains, organizations consider the entirety of organizational
                    systems and system components when developing policy on separation of
                    duties.</p>

                    the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish
                    required organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider
                    the creation of additional processes, roles, and system accounts as necessary,
                    to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the

                           <p class="p">Organizations have a variety of options for responding to risk including:
                    mitigating the risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing
                    controls; accepting the risk with appropriate justification or rationale;
                    sharing or transferring the risk; or rejecting the risk. Organizational risk
                    tolerance influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response is also
                    known as risk treatment. This control addresses the need to determine an
                    appropriate response to risk before a plan of action and milestones entry is
                    generated. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it
                    may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so a plan of action and
                    milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the
                    risk and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and
                    milestones entry is generated.</p>

                           <p class="p">Privacy impact assessments are an analysis of how information is managed to
                    ensure that such management conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy
                    requirements regarding privacy; to determine the associated privacy risks and
                    effects of creating, collecting, using, processing, storing, maintaining,
                    disseminating, disclosing, and disposing of information in identifiable form in
                    a system; and to examine and evaluate the protections and alternate processes
                    for managing information to mitigate potential privacy concerns. A privacy
                    impact assessment is an analysis and a formal document detailing the process and
                    outcome of the analysis. To conduct the analysis, organizations use risk
                    assessment processes. Although privacy impact assessments may be required by
                    law, organizations may develop policies to require privacy impact assessments in
                    circumstances where a privacy impact assessment would not be required by
                    law.</p>

                           <p class="p">Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant
                    protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example, supply chain
                    risk management, and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The
                    identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable
                    regulations, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines, system
                    functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and
                    component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct an end-to-end functional
                    decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components.
                    The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational
                    missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to
                    perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware
                    components that implement those functions, including when the functions are
                    shared by many components within and beyond the system boundary. The operational
                    environment of a system or component may impact the criticality including, for
                    example, the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices,
                    system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow
                    unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered
                    critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Component
                    and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or
                    function failure on the organizational missions supported by the system
                    containing those components and functions. A criticality analysis is performed
                    when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If
                    done early in the system life cycle, organizations may consider modifying the
                    system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions
                    by, for example, adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system
                    design.</p>

                    mitigating the risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing

                    sharing or transferring the risk; or rejecting the risk. Organizational risk
                    tolerance influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response is also
                    known as risk treatment. This control addresses the need to determine an
                    appropriate response to risk before a plan of action and milestones entry is
                    generated. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it
                    may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so a plan of action and
                    milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the
                    risk and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and
                    milestones entry is generated.</p>

                              <p class="p">Privacy impact assessments are an analysis of how information is managed to
                    ensure that such management conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy
                    requirements regarding privacy; to determine the associated privacy risks and
                    effects of creating, collecting, using, processing, storing, maintaining,
                    disseminating, disclosing, and disposing of information in identifiable form in
                    a system; and to examine and evaluate the protections and alternate processes
                    for managing information to mitigate potential privacy concerns. A privacy
                    impact assessment is an analysis and a formal document detailing the process and
                    outcome of the analysis. To conduct the analysis, organizations use risk
                    assessment processes. Although privacy impact assessments may be required by
                    law, organizations may develop policies to require privacy impact assessments in
                    circumstances where a privacy impact assessment would not be required by
                    law.</p>

                              <p class="p">Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require significant
                    protections. Criticality analysis is a key tenet of, for example, supply chain
                    risk management, and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The
                    identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable
                    regulations, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines, system
                    functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and
                    component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct an end-to-end functional
                    decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components.
                    The functional decomposition includes the identification of core organizational
                    missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to
                    perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware
                    components that implement those functions, including when the functions are
                    shared by many components within and beyond the system boundary. The operational
                    environment of a system or component may impact the criticality including, for
                    example, the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices,
                    system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow
                    unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered
                    critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities such components create. Component
                    and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or
                    function failure on the organizational missions supported by the system
                    containing those components and functions. A criticality analysis is performed
                    when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If
                    done early in the system life cycle, organizations may consider modifying the
                    system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions
                    by, for example, adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system
                    design.</p>
