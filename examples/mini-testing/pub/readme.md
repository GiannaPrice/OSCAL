# HTML renderings of sample catalog profiles

Note these files are produced by an application of an XSLT processing pipeline, which resolves and renders OSCAL profiles against their source catalogs.

The pipeline is the (generic) XProc pipeline `/working/lib/XProc/profile-resolve-and-display.xpl` 
which produces HTML files from OSCAL profiles (and other inputs). It has been run on each of the sample profiles in the parent directory, producing the file outputs stored here.

For best results, the file `oscal-html-fancy.css` should be kept in the subdirectory with the files.

The HTML files here can be opened in a browser to validate that controls and their settings (including parameter settings and augmentations) have been reflected properly in a catalog **as profiled**.
